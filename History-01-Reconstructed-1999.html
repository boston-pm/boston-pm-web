<p>We'll have two presentations at tomorrow's meeting.</p>
<p><strong>Ian Langworth</strong> will be giving a talk on <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Kwiki"><strong>Kwiki</strong></a>, a Wiki environment written in Perl.<br />
This will be an updated version of his talk from YAPC.</p>
<p>(<em>Narrator: This talk was the inspiration for Boston.PM getting it's on kWiki. And that kWiki provided a separate history. <strong>END OF AN ERA</strong></em>)</p>
<p>Also, <strong>Uri Guttman</strong> will give a talk on <strong>Parallel Sessions in Perl.</strong> Although I did not see this talk when Uri presented it at OSCON last week, my understanding is that it is <em>not</em> entirely about Stem.</p>
<p>In addition, we'll hear about our own <strong>Dan Sugalski getting hit in the face with a pie</strong> and other goings on at OSCON.</p>
<h2 id="tech-meeting-w-damian-conway-tuesday-july-13">Tech Meeting w/ Damian Conway, Tuesday, July 13</h2>
<p><strong>Damian Conway</strong> will be giving his <a href=""><strong>Everyday Perl</strong></a> presentation at tonight's meeting. <a href="">http://damian.conway.org/Seminars/Everyday.html 404-archived</a> To allow him more time, we'll be starting at 7pm (instead of the usual 7:30pm).</p>
<p><strong>Greg London,</strong> longtime Boston.pm member and author of <strong><em>Impatient Perl</em></strong>, will be sponsoring refreshments at tonight's meeting. At my suggestion, Greg will be providing cookies, pretzels, and other snacks. Please make your own arrangements for dinner.</p>
<blockquote>

<p><strong>Greg London</strong> showed off his new book, <strong>Impatient Perl,</strong> &quot;a Perl training manual for the hyperactive programmer&quot;, and gave out review copies. <a href="http://www.greglondon.com/" class="uri">http://www.greglondon.com/</a> has more info, as well as HTML and PDF versions of the book, and a link to the print-on-demand publisher lulu.com from which you can purchase a nice bound hard copy of the book.</p>
<p>I showed a short web script I've written for users of <a href="http://www.ricochetrobot.com/" class="uri">http://www.ricochetrobot.com/</a> , which is an online version of the Ricochet Robot board game. If you enjoy board games and puzzles, check out the site!</p>
<p>Ken highlighted some interesting Perl code in a project he's working on, leading to a discussion on methods for securely storing credit card data.</p>
<p>We also discussed Tim Kohl's templating needs and Chris Devers's DBM needs.</p>
<p>Afterwards, we went to Boston Beer Works, where we talked about board games and puzzles, the upcoming remake of Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, 30-foot-tall houses of cards, and digital photography.</p>
<p>Many thanks to Ken for going to get his laptop in the middle of the meeting, and to Tim for being the BU liaison this time around.</p>
<h2 id="tech-meeting-tues-may-18">Tech Meeting Tues, May 18</h2>
<p><strong>Uri</strong> will be giving his full presentation on <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Sort::Maker"><strong>Sort::Maker</strong></a>, a module that makes it easy to create powerful and efficient sorting functions.</p>

<p>Yes, Virginia, there is a tech meeting! Next Tuesday, April 27, we will have a meeting at Boston University, Kenmore Classroom Building, 565 Commonwealth Ave.</p>
<p>This will be our first meeting at BU; if it works out we may have future meetings there as well.</p>
<p>The format for this meeting will be a series of short talks. (Like lightning talks, but not necessarily limited to 5 minutes. :) So far, <strong>Uri Guttman, Greg London, and Sean Quinlan</strong> will each be speaking about projects they're working on. I'll (<em>Ronald Kimball</em>) also be looking for an interesting obfuscation to present for our amusement and/or bemusement.</p>
<p>If you're interested in giving a short presentation at this meeting (or a longer presentation at a future meeting), please let me know.</p>
<p>Thanks to <strong>Sean Quinlan</strong> for securing the meeting space for us!</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Sugalski"><strong>Dan Sugalski</strong></a> (<em>former Boston.pm local, Perl 5 core dev and chief architect for Perl 6 Parrot VM </em>) will be presenting a tutorial on Parrot.<br />
Here is his description of the talk:</p>
<p>The talk is a run-through of an Introduction to Parrot tutorial session I'm giving at the NordU conference later in January. It's a three hour (more or less) introduction to parrot, covering some history, the reasons and driving principles, and the basic architecture. There'll be some demo programs, including a demo of my current work project (a compiler for an old 4GL with integrated screen and DB handling--the demo program is a screen-based DB data editor that's entirely in parrot)</p>
<p>(<em>The <a href="http://www.parrot.org/">Parrot</a> VM was one of the original Perl 6 platforms.</em>) (<em>Dan was a co-author of <em>Perl 6 Essentials</em> (ISBN:<a href="https://isbn.nu/0-596-00499-0">0-596-00499-0</a>, Allison Randal, Dan Sugalski, Leopold TÃ¶tsch, 2003: Oâ€™Reilly &amp; Associates.</em>)</p>

<p><strong>Uri Guttman</strong> will be giving a short talk on his <strong>File::Slurp</strong> module, which provides a convenient way to read in an entire file.</p>
<p><strong>Bill Ricker</strong> will discuss solving word puzzles with Perl one-liners, such as the RN puzzle from Nov 23 at <a href="http://www.npr.org/programs/wesun/puzzle/" class="uri">http://www.npr.org/programs/wesun/puzzle/</a> .</p>
<p>Free review copies of three new books from O'Reilly: one each of the <em>Perl Cookbook</em> 2nd edition, <em>Learning Perl Objects, References, and Modules</em>, and the <em>Regular Expression Pocket Reference</em>. These will be given out on the condition of writing and posting a review.</p>

(<em>The <a href="http://www.parrot.org/">Parrot</a> VM was one of the original Perl 6 platforms.</em>)</p>
<p>We may hear from <strong>Kenneth Graves</strong> on his plan to port CLU to Parrot.</p>
<p>I'll also find an interesting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just_another_Perl_hacker">JAPH</a> or obfuscation for us to dissect.</p>
<p>Also, <strong>O'Reilly</strong> recently sent us a review copy of two different books, which I will give out at the meeting to Mongers who agree to write reviews in exchange. (Sorry, I don't have the books at hand; you'll just have to come to the meeting to find out the titles!)</p>
<h2 id="tech-meeting-tues-june-10---kevin-falcone---axkit">Tech Meeting Tues, June 10 - Kevin Falcone - AxKit</h2>
<p><strong>Kevin Falcone</strong> will be giving a talk on <strong>AxKit</strong>:</p>
<p>AxKit - Moving beyond static content with taglibs and providers</p>
<p>When developers start working with AxKit, their first thoughts are creating static XML pages and rejoicing in the separation of content and display that the stylesheet pipeline provides. However, once developers move beyond simple websites, AxKit provides two ways to aid in the generation of dynamic content. Taglibs provide custom tagsets for use in your pages, while providers are used to create modules that work like mod_perl handlers. This talk will compare and contrast these two approaches to dynamic content and provide examples of when each would be most useful for a site.</p>
<p>If you are speaking at YAPC or TPC, and would like to present your talk at this meeting, please let me know.</p>

<p>Due to scheduling conflicts, there will not be a Tech Meeting this week or next. Instead, the Tech Meeting will be on Wednesday, October 23. This is later in the month than usual, but it was the most workable date for myself and our hosts at Boston.com.</p>
<p><strong>Uri Guttman</strong> will be presenting &quot;A <a href="https://metacpan.org/dist/Stem">Stem</a> Cell Cookbook&quot;. This talk will cover how easy it is to create working Stem Cells and how to incrementally add features to make them more powerful.</p>
<p><strong>Jim Freeman</strong> will be presenting &quot;A New Kind Of Module&quot;.</p>
<h2 id="tech-meeting-tues-sep-17">Tech Meeting Tues, Sep 17</h2>
<p><strong>Uri</strong> has arranged a couple lightning talks for us.<br />
I (<em>Ronald J Kimball</em>) will be giving a lightning talk on my proposal for a new syntax for <code>L&lt;&gt;</code> in POD, and I believe Uri will be giving a lightning talk entitled &quot;the 'instant' Stem cookbook&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Greg London</strong> will give a half hour talk on his new module, <strong>EasyArgs</strong>, which makes using command line arguments easier.</p>
<p>This leaves us with time for one more mid-length talk. Let me know if you have something you'd like to present (whether it's a module, a script, an obfuscation, whatever), or a topic you'd like to have people discuss at the meeting.</p>
<p>Also, I will be giving out a review copy of two new O'Reilly books (which arrived the day after last month's meeting :/ ), <em>Mastering Regular Expressions</em> 2nd Ed and <em>Perl and LWP</em>.</p>
<h2 id="tech-meeting-tues-aug-13">Tech Meeting Tues, Aug 13</h2>
<p><strong>Federico Lucifredi</strong> will be giving a talk on Perl<code>&lt;-&gt;</code>Qt Bindings. Here's Federico's abstract for his talk:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The PerlQT bindings enable developers to create graphic applications in the scripting language of choice within the OpenSource movement. The author will initially cover all the Qt basics necessary to understand how GUI programming is done 'the Qt way' as well as Perl module programming fundamentals. After reviewing what changes in the Perl bindings we will then proceed to simultaneously review PerlQt and C++/Qt code showing the same functionality. This will conclude the presentation by highlighting the shortcomings of the currently available release of the bindings while at the same time providing a real world example of their use.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Additionally, <strong>Uri</strong> has arranged a lightning talk to begin the meeting. <strong>Jerrad Pierce</strong> will give a short talk on his <a href="https://metacpan.org/dist/Text-FIGlet">figlet module</a>. <strong>FIGlet</strong> is a program for drawing text in fancy ASCII letters. <a href="http://www.figlet.org" class="uri">http://www.figlet.org</a></p>

<p>Jesse Vincent will be giving a presentation on RT. Here's his blurb:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>RT is an enterprise-grade ticketing system built in perl. It's used by a couple thousand sites around the world to track bugs, manage customer service, manage a NOC and even track sales leads.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I suspect that folks would be more interested in seeing how RT is put together from the inside than that I rehash my &quot;how to use the tool&quot; schpiel. It's on the order of 25,000 lines of OO Perl. It's got a CLI frontend, an incoming mail gateway. It has a web UI written in HTML::Mason. It's got some automation to haul its dependencies down from CPAN in a slightly smarter way than vanilla CPAN prereqs. It's got a plugin architecture so that local sites can drop in custom business logic without having to modify the core codebase. Oh and it talks to an SQL database using DBIx::SearchBuilder to abstract out almost all of the database dependent behavior.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Afterwards, I'll have an obfuscation or some such to share. - Ronald</p>
<p>About 20 people attended the tech meeting at Boston.com last night.</p>
<p>Jesse Vincent presented RT, his enterprise-grade ticketing system built in Perl. He gave an overview of the system, showed it in use at rt.cpan.org, and discussed issues including module dependencies, managing a large project, and dealing with spam to the mail gateway.</p>
<p>For more on RT, go to http://www.fsck.com/projects/rt/</p>
<p>I presented a JAPH of mine that animates letters swapping around until they form the usual phrase. Tip: if your script produces no output, check the line endings. ;)</p>
<p>You can see the JAPH on Perl Monks at http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=77154</p>

<p>Greg London has offered to give a talk on his parser and profiler modules, Parse::Nibbler. &quot;The last tweak on version 1.08 has it parsing verilog at 1140 lines per second. The profiler is a module I wrote to attempt to track down subroutine usage and timing in the parser.&quot;</p>
<p>I've also found a very interesting obfuscation on Perl Monks for us to enjoy.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ronald</li>
</ul>
<p>Greg London presented Parse::Nibbler, his parsing module written in pure Perl. See his previously sent followup message for more details.</p>
<p>I presented an obfuscation by Marcus Post. The code is a stereogram which, when executed, rewrites itself to contain a new image! You can find this obfuscation on Perl Monks:</p>

<p>Okay, I've tabulated the votes for Damian's presentation. It looks like the practical won out over the fantastical (although with Damian you'll always get some of both) and the winning topic is...</p>
<p><strong>Perl6!</strong></p>

<p>P.S. Don't forget to RSVP to Uri (uri at sysarch.com) if you want to go to the social meeting on Sunday, July 8. Damian will be there too!</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>Now that we've all had time to recover from Damian Conway's information-packed presentation at last Monday's tech meeting, here's a followup on the meeting.</p>
<p>We had about 55 people, possibly our largest tech meeting ever. After introductions (which take a lot longer with 55 people!), Damian spoke for about three hours on the subject of Perl6. (With frequent threats to talk even longer. :) For more on Perl6, check out http://dev.perl.org</p>
<p>Halfway through, there was a break to give away goodies. Joe Johnston had brought several O'Reilly books, including the new XML book which he coauthored. I managed to come up with a new and amusing way to give away the books; each book went to the person who gave the best impression of the animal on the cover! Here's a quick summary:</p>
<p>CVS Pocket Reference (x4) Sheep Mastering Algorithms w/ Perl Wolf Advanced Perl Programming Panther Perl for System Administration Otter Programming Web Services w/ XML-RPC Jellyfish</p>
<p>There were also several copies of the Proceedings from last year's Perl Conference that Ranga Nathan had brought, and the Boston.com gang gave out funny little packets of paper-like mints.</p>
<p>Thanks to Boston.com for hosting, to Damian for presenting, and to everyone who showed up for being there.</p>

<p><strong>Reefknot: shared calendaring in Perl</strong></p>
<p><strong>Kirrily &quot;Skud&quot; Robert and Shane Landrum</strong></p>
<p>Have you ever wished your enterprise could do without MS Exchange? Ever wanted to schedule events with other members of your club, family, or organization? Do you use Perl? If so, you want to know about Reefknot.</p>
<p>Reefknot is a project to build standards-compliant shared calendaring tools in Perl. We want to make it easy for Perl programmers to build calendaring clients and servers that speak iCalendar (RFC2445) and other standard protocols.</p>
<p>The Reefknot project's major work to date is a major revision of Net::ICal; release 0.14 will be available soon on CPAN. We'll talk about the project's goals, show some of our recent work, and discuss what we're working on next. Bring your ideas for how you want to use calendaring tools.</p>
<p>See <a href="http://reefknot.sourceforge.net" class="uri">http://reefknot.sourceforge.net</a> for more information.</p>

<p>(<em>With the ReefKnot speakers</em>)</p>
<p>Some have expressed interest in having a social meeting, since there hasn't been one in a while. Well, here's your chance.</p>
<p>I'm anarchically calling a social meeting for Monday night (4/30), 6:30pm and after, at the Cambridge Brewing Company at Kendall Square. Since Skud's only going to be in town for a few days, this seemed like the best time. She and I will be there; feel free to join us. We'll do drinks and dinner, then ponder other amusements in the area (pool, movies?). Or maybe we'll just hang around and talk.</p>
<p>Please send me mail if you're planning on coming so I know how big of a table to ask for.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Boston.pm will be having a technical meeting this coming Tuesday, April 17, at the offices of Boston.com, starting at 7:30 pm.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I would like to present one of two projects that I have been working on recently:</p>
<p>The serious project is a package that allows for flexibly scheduling items, with limits on the number of items in certain time periods. Each item can control how it is rescheduled when there is a conflict.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Good news! I will be presenting the aforementioned scheduling package.</p>
<p>This package contains two modules, Time::Schedule and Time::Schedule::Item, which work together to create a schedule. The Time::Schedule object has limits on the number of items that may be scheduled within a certain time period (i.e. no more than three items every hour or six items every three hours).</p>
<p>When there is a conflict in inserting a new Time::Schedule::Item object, the object's reschedule() method is called with the next available time. The reschedule() method may simply return the suggested time, or it may calculate and return a preferred later time. In the latter case, reschedule() will be called again if that time is also unavailable. Alternatively, reschedule() may cancel the insertion by returning a negative number.</p>
<p>I designed this package with an eye towards flexibility. Thus: 1. The Time::Schedule object does not care what the items are, nor what the time units correspond to. 2. Each Time::Schedule::Item may have its own arbitrarily complex reschedule() method. 3. Derived classes may be created from either or both modules.</p>

<h2 id="tech-meeting-tues-march-13">Tech Meeting Tues March 13</h2>
<p>James Freeman will be presenting PISE, rescheduled from the previous meeting. PISE is a system for creating web interfaces to command line tools via XML.</p>
<p>Other topics of discussion may include the DeCSS code that we've been discussing on the list. Does anyone know how it works? :)</p>
<hr />
<p>Another successful meeting at Boston.com! We had about 20 people at the meeting last Tuesday.</p>
<p>James Freeman presented presented PISE, a system written in Perl for creating web interfaces to command line tools using XML templates. The system has some very nice features, such as forking a process to execute the command line in case it will take a long time to finish. It was noted that the Perl code wanted some improvements, however.</p>
<p>While James was setting up, I played with the nifty features of the Boston.pm projector, such as pointers, underlining, and zoom. Reading the manual really does pay off! :)</p>
<p>After the presentation, we discussed the short DeCSS code that was recently posted to the list. I reviewed a thread on the Fun With Perl list, that resulted in the code shrinking from 526 characters to 472. I wasn't able to explain the algorithm used in the code, though.</p>
<p>Thanks to James for the presentation, Boston.com for hosting, and everyone who attended!</p>
<p>If you are interested in giving a presentation at a future Boston.pm technical meeting, let me know! If you're giving a presentation at an upcoming conference, this is a great way to rehearse.</p>
<p>Ronald</p>
<p>P.S. <strong>Uri</strong> brought three copies of <em>Network Programming with Perl</em> and <em>Data Munging with Perl</em>, and gave them to those who gave the most convincing sob stories about why they needed one book or the other.<br />
<strong>Nancy</strong>'s tale of woe involving Visual Basic and inconsistent fixed width formatting was especially heart-rending. :)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I was touched by the fact that the VB code was written by a <em>manager</em>. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Gosh, I'm honored that my sob story was so well received. The tough part is that it's TRUE! We're still struggling with those VB files even today - but I hope to get Perl to the rescue soon. (At least we'll start using Perl to enforce the interfaces we create.) - Nancy V.</p>

<p>Boston Perl Mongers is having a technical meeting this Tuesday, February 13, <strong>at the offices of Boston.com</strong> near South Station, starting at 7pm.</p>
<p>Andrew Langmead will be posting directions.</p>
<p>The topic for the meeting is practical applications of XML. James Freeman will present the open source software package Pise (Pasteur Institute Software Environment). An abstract of this talk is included below. Mike MacHenry will present Any2XML, a set of modules that will allow extraction of selected data from any text file into one or more XML documents using a template which is also an XML document.</p>
<p>Pizza and beverages will be provided.</p>

<p>Pise (Pasteur Institute Software Environment)</p>
<p><a href="http://www-alt.pasteur.fr/~letondal/Pise/" class="uri">http://www-alt.pasteur.fr/~letondal/Pise/</a></p>
<p>Abstract of James Freeman's presentation:</p>
<p>There is a growing field called Bioinformatics, that can be defined as understanding complex biological systems through the use of experiments tied with computer-based data storage, tracking, and analysis. Software written in this field is usually written to run on the Unix command line. Traditional biologists find learning the command line for each new tool confusing, difficult, and consuming time better spent in the lab. As a result a local programmer in the lab is tasked to wrap the command line into a cgi-bin script with the usual html input and html output pages. PISE (Pasteur Institute Software Environment, http://www-alt.pasteur.fr/~letondal/Pise/), written by Catherine Letondal, has been created to automate this process by writing a system to parse a single XML definition of the command line tool. Parsing this XML definition the PISE system automatically generates an html form, a Perl cgi-bin processing script; an html output form and, if necessary, post processing as well. These features plus automatic defaulting, specification of simple and complex interface options, and many other features makes this an extremely valuable system. This system was developed for Bioinformatics, and the default XML interfaces are for these kinds of command line tools, but it has been simple to create new XML interfaces. The PISE system is general enough to handle any program that runs on the Unix command line. I will present this system at the next tech meeting.</p>
<p>Last month's tech meeting was held on Tuesday, Feb 13 at the offices of Boston.com, shortly before the mailing list went down.</p>
<p>Mike MacHenry presented Any2XML, a set of modules for extracting data from any text file into one or more XML documents using a template which is also an XML document. Mike explained the whole process and showed various examples.</p>
<p>Mike's presentation led to an involved discussion of XML.</p>
<p>Elaine gave away several programming books, to the amusement of everyone in the room. ;)</p>
<p>I presented an obfuscation by Colonel Panic of perlmonks.org, which was built on the japh.pm module. Or was it...?</p>
<p>Thanks to everyone who attended! The Boston.com locale worked out great, so we'll be meeting there again.</p>
<p>Hopefully this message will go through with all the list headers and the subject line properly set. Announcement of this month's technical meeting to follow.</p>

<p>this is what i envisioned these meetings to be. everyone learned/taught something and had fun.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Greetings! About a week ago, the old Boston.pm mailing list at <code>darkridge.com</code> went down. Now, thanks to Chris Nandor and Ben Hockenhull, we have a brand new list at <code>hfb.pm.org</code>! To send mail to our new list, address it to <code>boston-pm at hfb.pm.org</code> .</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We've done our best to create the new mailing list with the most up-to-date subscriber list from the old mailing list, but it is possible that recent subscriptions/unsubscriptions will need to be repeated.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We apologize for any inconvenience this situation may have caused, and hope you will enjoy our new list.</p>
