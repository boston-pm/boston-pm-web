<p>Boston.pm is the Boston chapter of the international <a href="https://www.pm.org/">Perl Mongers</a> collection of <a href="https://www.perl.org">Perl</a> user groups, founded in 1998.</p>
<p>The group welcomes anyone to join our mailing list and attend our meetings.</p>
<h1 id="meetings">Meetings</h1>
<h2 id="technical-meeting-series">Technical Meeting Series</h2>
<p>Boston PM has had in-person technical meetings in the Greater Boston area for 20+ years (pre-plague).</p>
<p>For a calendar of up-coming meetings, see below at <a href="#schedule">Schedule</a>.</p>
<p>For past calendar and annals of history, see the <a href="History-00.html">History</a> pages.</p>
<p>In the Virtual Meeting world, Boston PM participates in three sets of meetings:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Meetings arranged and hosted by Boston.PM are in <a href="https://meet.Jit.si">meet.Jit.si</a> and on 2d Tuesday. See below at Schedule and BoilerPlate for details.</p></li>
<li><p>Meetings arranged and hosted by <a href="https://www.meetup.com/charlotte-pm/">Charlotte.PM</a> are in Zoom and on Last Wednesdays. Boston.pm provides publicity and attendees for these meetings. Charlotte records these.</p></li>
<li><p>Meetings hosted by Boston Linux Unix (<a href="http://blu.org" class="uri">http://blu.org</a>) are in <a href="https://meet.Jit.si">Jitsi</a> and on 3d Wednesday. These are POSIX or hardware related, not Perl related. BLU records these and publishes on YouTube.</p>
<ul>
<li>Bill Ricker, Boston.pm facilitator, regularly invites Boston.PM to his <a href="https://blu.org/">BLU</a> presentations and others we think will be of interest. These tend to be POSIX as opposed to Perl, though both Bill and Federico Lucifredi tend to have some Perl in support of their projects.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>(A few of our older, in-person Boston.pm meetings (2014-2015) are on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCY0sL_ILd6JUixlppAQlgsA/videos">YouTube</a> mostly when we had a remote speaker via YouTube/Hangouts, but we haven‚Äôt been adding to this collection.)</p>
<h2 id="social-meetings">Social Meetings</h2>
<p>In normal times, Boston.pm does non-technical, social meetings. Typically this involves a restaurant or bar but could be a coffee-shop, public park, house-party, whatever.</p>
<p>There is no regular schedule. Typically these are negotiated among interested folks on the Discuss mailing-list.</p>

<p>(<em>Are Mailing Lists Anti-Social media?</em>)</p>
<p>Boston.pm has two email lists supported by center Perl Mongers. Mailman list management has the official archives being password protected, visible only to list members. <strong>HOWEVER NOTE</strong> that both lists are logged by one or more popular archival websites that have subscribed to the lists, so these lists are effectively public.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://mail.pm.org/mailman/listinfo/boston-pm-announce">Announce list</a> is moderated, intended for meeting &amp; social announcements and cancellations and other such things. <a href="https://www.mail-archive.com/boston-pm-announce@mail.pm.org/info.html">Unofficial Public Archive, 2008-present</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://mail.pm.org/mailman/listinfo/boston-pm">Discuss list</a> is un-moderated, available for discussion of Perl-ish topics, discussions before and after meetings, etc. <a href="https://www.mail-archive.com/boston-pm@pm.org/info.html">Unofficial Public Archive, 2002-2018</a> (<em>2002-2008 there was a single list, that history is here.</em>)</p></li>

<h1 id="schedule">Schedule</h1>
<p><strong>Since we‚Äôre having speakers from the UK the next two months, we‚Äôll be starting 6:30pm ET so that we‚Äôre at least <em>starting</em> on Tuesday for them.</strong></p>
<h2 id="tuesday-march-14th-œÄ-day-day-630-boston-pm-ovidtapeleonerdlive-on-corinna---oo-in-perl5-core">Tuesday, March 14th (œÄ day = ü•ß day), 6:30 üá∫üá∏ Boston PM: Ovid(tape)+LeoNerd(live) on Corinna - OO in Perl5 Core</h2>
<p>We‚Äôll have <strong>Curtis <em>‚ÄúOvid‚Äù</em> Poe</strong> on the strategy of Corinna project and <strong>Paul ‚Äú<a href="https://metacpan.org/author/PEVANS"><code>PEVANS</code></a>/<a href="http://www.leonerd.org.uk/"><code>LeoNerd</code></a>‚Äù Evans</strong>, Perl Steering Committe and <code>Object::Pad implementor</code>, live for the practicalities and Q&amp;A.</p>
<p>Last summer, Ovid posted exciting news -</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúFor #perl devs wondering how the Corinna #oop project is going, <span class="citation" data-cites="cpan_pevans">@cpan_pevans</span> is now working on stage 1 of the accepted portion of the RFC. I‚Äôve put that in the <a href="https://github.com/Ovid/Cor/blob/master/rfc/mvp.md">repo</a> so you can follow along‚Äù<br />
<a href="https://twitter.com/OvidPerl/status/1560305460707827715"><code>@OvidPerl</code> 2022-08-18</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just recently in mid February 2023, Ovid and Paul again shared exciting news: P5P‚Äôs upcoming development release Perl 5.37.9 (alpha/beta for 5.40.0) will contain<br />
<strong><code>use feature 'class';</code></strong><br />
It has been merged.</p>
<p>Ovid is the architect and Paul is the lead developer for adding a new object-oriented system called Corinna‚Ä† (formerly &amp; confusingly ‚ÄúCor‚Äù into Perl 5 Core. They‚Äôve had an open community process to develop an RFC or proposal and prototype, but until recently, without commitment for the Perl 5 Porters (P5P) to actually implement it in Perl 5. Over the summer, P5P have approved the initial Stage 1 integration into Perl Core. While we‚Äôve had 20+ years of new OO packages for Perl5 since 5.0, this is the first actual (as opposed to proposed) overhaul of the <em>core</em> OO system in Perl 5.</p>
<p>PEVANS‚Äôs non-Core, prototype is <a href="https://metacpan.org/dist/Object-Pad">Object::Pad</a>, which can be conditionally imported in compatibility mode via <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Feature::Compat::Class">Feature::Compat::Class</a>.</p>
<p>Ovid‚Äôs recent writing on Corinna are <a href="https://ovid.github.io/tags/corinna.html">on his blog</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/Ovid/Cor">Corinna project</a> has a <a href="https://github.com/Ovid/Cor/wiki">wiki</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/Ovid/Cor#rfc">RFC</a> that proposed adding Corinna to Perl 5 Core, and the P5P-accepted Stage 1 <a href="https://github.com/Ovid/Cor/blob/master/rfc/mvp.md">Minimal Viable Product RFC</a>. <a href="https://dev.to/ovid/bringing-modern-oo-to-perl-51ak">His 2021 editorial</a> explains the difference between Moose (<em>et al</em>), Stevan Little‚Äôs Moxie, and Corinna.</p>
<p><strong><em>Damian Conway</em></strong> posted an exultation for the (January 2022) P5P approval of the Stage 1 MVP RFC <em>but i can‚Äôt find it again</em>. His previous writings endorsing the project are</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/damian_conway/2021/12/a-not-so-simple-matter-of-privacy.html">A (not so) simple matter of privacy 2021-DEC</a>,</li>

</ul>
<p>‚Ä† <em>Corinna</em> is a classical allusion in connection to Curtis‚Äôs pseudonym <em>Ovid</em>, which explains the classical (and otherwise potentially NSFW) image on the MVP RFC tweet.</p>

<p>This is a JitSi meeting. The secure URL will be computed by this command (valid only during that week):</p>

<h2 id="jitsi-notes">JITSI notes</h2>
<p><a href="https://meet.jit.si">Jitsi</a> is a Free/Libre OSS project sponsored by 8x8 (an Atlassian spin-off). It is the freemium base for their added-value corporate meeting &amp; VOIP platform. As FLOSS, it can be self-hosted; they provide a free demo server. We will currently be using the free demo server, but may migrate to a hosted server (where we can set defaults, privileges).</p>
<p>Natick FOSS group has an updated <a href="http://runeman.org/articles/natick-foss/jitsi/jitsi-2022-09-05.pdf">5-page Jitsi Help .pdf file</a>, and you can practice beforehand. (They meet 1st Thursdays, online, early afternoon - (semi)retired users.)</p>
<p>One can use plain web mode, but you can install the browser plug-in if you like (recommended if sharing slides or terminal). There are also iOS (iPhone/iPad) and Android Jitsi <a href="https://jitsi.org/downloads/">apps</a> which work well (not for screen-share from Android). Screen-sharing may require a browser with paranoid modes off, e.g.¬†Firefox Private Window or Chromium Temporary Profile.</p>
<p><a href="https://jitsi.github.io/handbook/docs/user-guide/keyboard-shortcuts">JITSI keyboard shortcuts</a></p>
<p>JITSI scales fine to more people in face-sharing Brady-Bunch / Hollywood Squares mode than you can easily see at once (30ish) and if folks turn off their cameras when just listening/talking, i.e.¬†when not commenting/presenting, it scales much higher. (If we later get more folks than will comfortably fit in Jitsi, we can set up a stream to YouTubeLive or some other platform ‚Ä¶ or upgrade to a proper panelist platform feeding a stream, but the ‚Äúseminar‚Äù quality of Jitsi is fine for our level of anarchy.)</p>
<p>I will routinely mute those not presenting so you‚Äôll usually need to unmute to comment. Hint: Space-bar is push to talk, M is mute/unmute (on phone/tablet it‚Äôs the skeuomorphic microphone, avoid the handset hangup button!).</p>
