<p>Boston.pm is the Boston chapter of the international <a
href="https://www.pm.org/">Perl Mongers</a> collection of <a
href="https://www.perl.org">Perl</a> user groups, founded in 1998.</p>
<p>The group welcomes anyone to join our mailing list and attend our
meetings.</p>
<h1 id="meetings">Meetings</h1>
<h2 id="technical-meeting-series">Technical Meeting Series</h2>
<p>Boston PM has had in-person technical meetings in the Greater Boston
area for 20+ years (pre-plague).</p>
<p>For a calendar of up-coming meetings, see below at <a
href="#schedule">Schedule</a>.</p>
<p>For past calendar and annals of history, see the <a
href="History-00.html">History</a> pages.</p>
<p>In the Virtual Meeting world, Boston PM participates in three sets of
meetings:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Meetings arranged and hosted by Boston.PM are in <a
href="https://meet.Jit.si">meet.Jit.si</a> and on 2d Tuesday. See below
at Schedule and BoilerPlate for details.</p></li>
<li><p>Meetings arranged and hosted by <a
href="https://www.meetup.com/charlotte-pm/">Charlotte.PM</a> are in Zoom
and on Last Wednesdays. Boston.pm provides publicity and attendees for
these meetings. Charlotte records these.</p></li>
<li><p>Meetings hosted by Boston Linux Unix (<a href="http://blu.org"
class="uri">http://blu.org</a>) are in <a
href="https://meet.Jit.si">Jitsi</a> and on 3d Wednesday. These are
POSIX or hardware related, not Perl related. BLU records these and
publishes on YouTube.</p>
<ul>
<li>Bill Ricker, Boston.pm facilitator, regularly invites Boston.PM to
his <a href="https://blu.org/">BLU</a> presentations and others we think
will be of interest. These tend to be POSIX as opposed to Perl, though
both Bill and Federico Lucifredi tend to have some Perl in support of
their projects.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>(A few of our older, in-person Boston.pm meetings (2014-2015) are on
<a
href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCY0sL_ILd6JUixlppAQlgsA/videos">YouTube</a>
mostly when we had a remote speaker via YouTube/Hangouts, but we haven‚Äôt
been adding to this collection.)</p>
<h2 id="social-meetings">Social Meetings</h2>
<p>In normal times, Boston.pm does non-technical, social meetings.
Typically this involves a restaurant or bar but could be a coffee-shop,
public park, house-party, whatever.</p>
<p>There is no regular schedule. Typically these are negotiated among
interested folks on the Discuss mailing-list.</p>

<p>(<em>Are Mailing Lists Anti-Social media?</em>)</p>
<p>Boston.pm has two email lists supported by center Perl Mongers.
Mailman list management has the official archives being password
protected, visible only to list members. <strong>HOWEVER NOTE</strong>
that both lists are logged by one or more popular archival websites that
have subscribed to the lists, so these lists are effectively public.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a

Oct 11, 7pm ET üá∫üá∏ Boston PM: Ovid+LeoNerd on Corinna - OO in Perl5
Core</h2>
<p>We‚Äôll have live remote guests <strong>Curtis <em>‚ÄúOvid‚Äù</em>
Poe</strong> and <strong>Paul ‚Äú<a
href="https://metacpan.org/author/PEVANS"><code>PEVANS</code></a>/<a
href="http://www.leonerd.org.uk/"><code>LeoNerd</code></a>‚Äù
Evans</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúFor #perl devs wondering how the Corinna #oop project is going,
<span class="citation" data-cites="cpan_pevans">@cpan_pevans</span> is
now working on stage 1 of the accepted portion of the RFC. I‚Äôve put that
in the repo so you can follow along‚Äù<br />

</blockquote>
<p>Ovid is the architect and Paul is the lead developer for adding a new
object-oriented system called Corinna‚Ä† (formerly &amp; confusingly ‚ÄúCor‚Äù
into Perl 5 Core. They‚Äôve had an open community process to develop an
RFC or proposal and prototype, but until recently, without commitment
for the Perl 5 Porters (P5P) to actually implement it in Perl 5. Over
the summer, P5P have approved the initial Stage 1 integration into Perl
Core. While we‚Äôve had 20+ years of new OO packages for Perl5 since 5.0,
this is the first actual (as opposed to proposed) overhaul of the
<em>core</em> OO system in Perl 5.</p>
<p>PEVANS‚Äôs compatible, non-Core, prototype is <a
href="https://metacpan.org/dist/Object-Pad">Object::Pad</a>.</p>
<p>Ovid‚Äôs recent writing on Corinna are <a
href="https://ovid.github.io/tags/corinna.html">on his blog</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/Ovid/Cor">Corinna project</a> has a
<a href="https://github.com/Ovid/Cor/wiki">wiki</a> and the <a
href="https://github.com/Ovid/Cor#rfc">RFC</a> that proposed adding
Corinna to Perl 5 Core, and the P5P-accepted Stage 1 <a
href="https://github.com/Ovid/Cor/blob/master/rfc/mvp.md">Minimal Viable
Product RFC</a>. <a
href="https://dev.to/ovid/bringing-modern-oo-to-perl-51ak">His 2021
editorial</a> explains the difference between Moose (<em>et al</em>),
Stevan Little‚Äôs Moxie, and Corinna.</p>
<p><strong><em>Damian Conway</em></strong> posted an exultation for the
(January 2022) P5P approval of the Stage 1 MVP RFC <em>but i can‚Äôt find
it again</em>. His previous writings endorsing the project are</p>
<ul>

<p>‚Ä† <em>Corinna</em> is a classical allusion in connection to Curtis‚Äôs
pseudonym <em>Ovid</em>, which explains the classical (and otherwise
potentially NSFW) image on the MVP RFC tweet.</p>
<p>This is a JitSi meeting. The secure URL will be computed by this

<h2 id="jitsi-notes">JITSI notes</h2>
<p><a href="https://meet.jit.si">Jitsi</a> is a Free/Libre OSS project
sponsored by 8x8 (an Atlassian spin-off). It is the freemium base for
their added-value corporate meeting &amp; VOIP platform. As FLOSS, it
can be self-hosted; they provide a free demo server. We will currently
be using the free demo server, but may migrate to a hosted server (where
we can set defaults, privileges).</p>
<p>Natick FOSS group has an updated <a
href="http://runeman.org/articles/natick-foss/jitsi/jitsi-2022-09-05.pdf">5-page
Jitsi Help .pdf file</a>, and you can practice beforehand. (They meet
1st Thursdays, online, early afternoon - (semi)retired users.)</p>
<p>One can use plain web mode, but you can install the browser plug-in
if you like (recommended if sharing slides or terminal). There are also
iOS (iPhone/iPad) and Android Jitsi <a
href="https://jitsi.org/downloads/">apps</a> which work well (not for
screen-share from Android). Screen-sharing may require a browser with
paranoid modes off, e.g.¬†Firefox Private Window or Chromium Temporary
Profile.</p>
<p><a
href="https://jitsi.github.io/handbook/docs/user-guide/keyboard-shortcuts">JITSI
keyboard shortcuts</a></p>
<p>JITSI scales fine to more people in face-sharing Brady-Bunch /
Hollywood Squares mode than you can easily see at once (30ish) and if
folks turn off their cameras when just listening/talking, i.e.¬†when not
commenting/presenting, it scales much higher. (If we later get more
folks than will comfortably fit in Jitsi, we can set up a stream to
YouTubeLive or some other platform ‚Ä¶ or upgrade to a proper panelist
platform feeding a stream, but the ‚Äúseminar‚Äù quality of Jitsi is fine
for our level of anarchy.)</p>
<p>I will routinely mute those not presenting so you‚Äôll usually need to
unmute to comment. Hint: Space-bar is push to talk, M is mute/unmute (on
phone/tablet it‚Äôs the skeuomorphic microphone, avoid the handset hangup
button!).</p>
