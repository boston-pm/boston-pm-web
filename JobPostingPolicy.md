## 

 Job opportunities may be posted to the Boston.pm [general mailing list](https://mail.pm.org/mailman/listinfo/boston-pm), however, please follow the procedure below.

The purpose of this policy is two-fold; to keep the list from being overwhelmed with job postings, and to make sure that the job postings have sufficient information and are appropriate to the list.

Job postings may not be posted directly to the list. Instead, job postings should be sent to

```
 bostopmjobs2017 (at) tommetro (dot) com
```

One of us will review each posting, and either post it to the list or return it to the sender for editing.

When we send an approved job posting to the list, the Subject header will include the string `[job]`

Guidelines for job postings:

1. Perl must be a primary aspect of the job.

2. The job must be located in the greater Boston area.

3. The following information should be included in the job posting:

    - Required skill-set
    - Contract or permanent position?
    -   Pay range, for contract positions
    -   Incentives, for permanent positions
    - Placement through a recruiter, or directly with the company?
    - Location, and whether telecommuting is available
    - Company's product or service
