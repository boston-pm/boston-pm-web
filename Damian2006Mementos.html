<h2>Uri&#39;s Notes</h2>
<p>there was a massive turnout tonight for damian&#39;s talks. i counted 77
mongers and guests and only about 45-50 sent in rsvps! the rest of you
should be very ashamed of yourselves as we did sorta run out of pizza!
18 pies was the order for an estimated 50+. so you who didn&#39;t rsvp and
ate pizza stole it from the starving mouths of those who showed up a bit
late and did rsvp! next time, do the right thing and rsvp so we order
the right amount. now on to more nice things. :&#41;

</p>
<p>thanx to the primary sponsors, greg london and richard morse. with their
donations and hat passing we collected about $370 and our pizza expense
was about $280 so the rest will go to tpf.

</p>
<p>thanx to those who brought drinks, paper goods and foil. and to those
who helped set up the pizza tables. and to that solo guy who was
cleaning up while damian started his second talk.

</p>
<p>thanx to those silly foil hat contestants. we will have to put some of
those pix on our wiki. some of the foil hats were very cute and
functional! some of you should go become milleners &#40;see danny kaye in
secret life of walter mitty for a great song about that&#41;. and the
casualty rate was very low for a damian talk so the hat protection
factors were high.

</p>
<p>thanx to <a href="http://www.bestfriendscocoa.com">Best Friends Cocoa</a> &#40;hey, i gotta plug the wife&#39;s biz! 
{ <i>Editor&#39;s Note</i> - <em>Shouldn&#39;t that have TM and SM all over it?</em> <i>wdr</i> }&#41;
for donating the prizes for the hat contest. get some for the fall/winter
weather. makes a great ice breaker at naughty parties!

{ <i>New Editor&#39;s Note</i> - BFC website is still up in 2013 but business closed in 2012. <i>wdr</i> }&#41;

</p>
<p>thanx to all the attendees for laughing constantly throughout the
talks. most of you couldn&#39;t help it so that is understandable. :&#41;

</p>
<p>thanx to damian for always giving us a talk when he is in town and for
tonight&#39;s mind melting and patented CXAP. now that most of you have seen
it, his pun on google&#39;s name is amazing to me in that no one has ever
&#40;to my knowledge&#41; made it before.

</p>
<p>thanx to bill ricker for helping damian setup and for driving him home
after damian drove us nutso.

</p>
<p>all in all a very fun and successful evening. hopefully many of you will
come to other boston perl monger meetings where we don&#39;t have such
famous speakers and just talk perl stuff. we do have some very
interesting talks so come on down!


</p>
<p>thanx,

</p>

<p>And during intermission, those willing to be judged were paraded at the front of the room for Damian &#40;foreground right&#41; to judge, with Uri&#39;s able interference.

</p>
<p>Damian declined to score each entry three ways numerically, 
and instead awarded the four prizes 
&#40;4 different flavors of <strong>&lt;flash&gt;</strong> Best Friends Cocoa <strong>&lt;flash/&gt;</strong>&#41; 
intuitively, one for each of the above and one for Judge&#39;s Choice or Most Imaginative.
