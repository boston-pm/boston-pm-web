<p><em>Twice postponed because Valentines had basically 0 RSVP and Pi(e) Day 3.14 had a Blizzard Watch</em></p>
<p>I’m a bit of a digital pack-rat, so I will be showing a tool that I developed to help me hoard Tumblr meme posts. As a bonus, just for this talk I wrote something in Perl 6 that does a similar task for XKCD.</p>
<p>(So if you're looking for ways to capture unstructured (no API) data from the web with Perl, this talk is for you.) ​</p>

<p>Join us to see what's new in the latest Perl. Using slides prepared by brian d foy for an AmsterdamX.pm presentation, we'll go over the highlights of new features and changes in Perl 5.26, including the potential disruptive change of removing the current directory (.) from the <span class="citation">@INC</span> module search path. We'll supplement the slides with the official Perl Delta (change log) document, and other online sources where more depth is required. The talk will be an open discussion format, with Bill Ricker leading us through the slides, but plenty of opportunity for the audience to ask questions, or offer opinion, and in some cases we'll try some live demos of the new features.</p>

<p><em>Another MST3K YouTube TPC/YAPC screening and discussion</em></p>
<p>Damian Conway, known for his rapid-paced, wide-ranging, tour-de-force presentations, was the keynote presenter at The Perl Conference, 2017 (formerly known as YAPC::NA). In his keynote he tells &quot;a tale of madness, obsession, and coding extremity,&quot; describing what it took to bring 3 keywords from Perl 6 to Perl 5. A community effort that took three years and 2.8 million lines of code. This is a more extreme example of what some developers are going through to bring Perl 6 functionality to Perl 5.</p>
<p>We will watch his recorded keynote and discuss among ourselves.</p>
<p>Even if you are new to Perl and don't follow all the technical details, Damian's highly entertaining presentations are a must see. (Plus, after the talk when we discuss it, we'll happily answer any questions.)</p>
<p>About the speaker <strong>Damian Conway</strong> is an author or co-author of numerous Perl books, and a widely sought-after speaker and trainer.</p>

<h2 id="tuesday-october-10th---github-continuous-integration-for-perl-cpan-modules">Tuesday, October 10th - GitHub Continuous Integration for Perl CPAN modules</h2>
<p>Tonight (<em>As an emergency substitute talk</em>) we will be having a mini-hackathon on the <code>Config::Std</code> CPAN module that Boston.pm maintains. We'll be offering a live demonstration of setting up continuous integration (CI) using Travis CI and Appveyor, two hosted CI tools made freely available for open source projects on GitHub. Join us as we stumble through the process and learn from our mistakes.</p>
<p>Perl has had <code>Test::Harness</code> for decades, with CPANTS providing distributed Continuous Integration testing of Released CPAN module distributions for a decade or more. Thank you CPANTS volunteers for creating a distributed cloud for us :-). Now GitHub is offering similar capabilities to all the other FLOSS communities via free integration with freemium cloud Continuous Integration tools Travis-CI (for Linux) and Appveyor (for Windows). Since we have CPANTS for release, we can use Travis-ci&amp;Appveyor to test our DEV branch after check-in. They'll even test Pull Requests before merge! Any GitHub FLOSS project can use these, but Perl CPAN projects can make use easily since we already have a regression testing culture, we won't need to write the tests, just enable them.</p>
<h2 id="nov.-14th---adam-russell-live---deep-learning-in-perl">Nov. 14th - Adam Russell (live!) - &quot;Deep Learning in Perl&quot;</h2>
<p><strong>LIVE Speaker !</strong></p>
<p><em>Remember, if you get Veterans' Day Monday off work, Tuesday will feel like Monday.</em></p>
<p><strong>&quot;Deep Learning with AI::MXNet: Navigating implementation issues&quot;</strong></p>
<p>ABSTRACT This talk will cover lessons learned from a recent experience in getting a deep learning projected started, with little prior experience in AI. All code will use the Perl MXNet API and guide the audience through developing a simple model, which is then built on to perform more complex tasks.</p>
<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) has for a long time captured the popular imagination. Results from academia and industry have finally started to deliver on some of the long hoped for results: self driving cars, automated medical diagnoses, and written and verbal language processing. These areas are showing advances that were once simply products of fiction writers. The current wave of AI enthusiasm may be attributed to what is called Deep Learning which is a convenient label for relatively new techniques using neural networks. The possibility for increased automation across virtually every industry has resulted in the spinning up of many new startup companies, as well as new projects within existing enterprises, resulting in the need to develop the skills necessary to pursue this new area.</p>
<p>While not the language of production, Perl is used to develop algorithms and demonstrate concepts before they receive fuller treatment. Deep Learning practitioners often begin their deep learning work, correctly, with a review of the literature and research into the fundamentals. Projects then often start confidently with high hopes, built on that conceptual understanding, only to quickly get bogged down in unforeseen, but critically important, issues of implementation.</p>
<p><strong>Adam Russell</strong> is a software engineer with OptumLabs' Center for Applied Data Science (CADS). CADS is tasked with developing prototype applications which implement recent advances in algorithms and technology to address issues of importance to Optum business interests. Most recent projects have been focused on Deep Learning. Adam has a PhD in Computer Science from the University of Massachusetts Lowell, his academic interests involve Computational Geometry and Data Visualization and these explorations, much like the work described in this talk, are all Perl driven. He also teaches, on an adjunct basis, at Wentworth Institute of Technology in Boston.</p>

<p><em>topic originally scheduled for January</em></p>
<p><strong>Amsterdam Perl Conference 2017 video screening</strong></p>
<p>Noted Perl personality <strong>Ovid (Curtis Poe)</strong> has built a Space-exploration on-line role-playing-game called &quot;Tau Station&quot; in Perl. It's even a business. In this talk, he describes the games industry and how Modern Perl makes building his game fun.</p>
<p>Original Abstract -</p>
<p>&quot;With Tau Station, we're building a sci-fi universe in a browser. However, in object oriented design, what does the &quot;single responsibility principle&quot; mean when your combat armor serves as armor, a weapon, and medkit?</p>
<p>&quot;And when many different behaviors have long chains of duplicated requirements (for example, do you have enough money to buy a medkit, or refuel your ship, or repair your blaster, or bribe a guard), how do you handle that in an efficient an easy to read manner?</p>
<p>&quot;And how do you avoid god objects when your character in the universe drives almost everything?</p>
<p>&quot;This talk explores some of the techniques we've developed for Tau Station to easily model complex behaviors.&quot;</p>
<p>We'll have our usual community discussion after (or by hitting pause as needed) in lieu of speaker Q&amp;A.</p>

<p>Abstract: Using the lowest amount of custom hardware and pouring Perl over everything as the glue binding it all, we create two minimalistic devices delivering a perfectly tuned network time source (synchronizing with a GPS satellite), and a naturally random entropy source (leveraging a Geiger tube’s measurement of natural background radiation).</p>

<p><em>Meetings resume ! September at the usual place</em></p>
<p>After ringing a bell for 45 minutes to 3 hours, you kind of want people to know you did it, and what you did it for. Ricky uses Perl 6 to replace a manual process for creating “half-sheets” to post in the Old North ringing room, for tourists to see.</p>
<p>Ricky sensibly doesn't want to retype or copy-paste what's already somewhere on-line, so he uses Perl 6 to pull the data from a database as XML, and then typeset the half sheets. This is using <strong>Perl6, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groff_%28software%29">GROFF</a>,</strong> and <strong>C6PAN Modules</strong> <code>Template::Mustache</code>, <code>XML::XPath</code>, and <code>HTTP::User Agent</code>.</p>

<p><strong><em>Hosted by <a href="https://blu.org">BLU</a> Boston Linux Unix</em></strong></p>
<p>Moderator: <strong>Greg Rundlett,</strong> founder of eQuality Technology</p>
<p><strong>A guided tour of QualityBox, a MediaWiki hosting service</strong></p>
<p>Abstract:</p>
<p>Greg Rundlett, founder of eQuality Technology, has created a hosted software service called QualityBox which is provides the wiki engine (MediaWiki) that drives Wikipedia. Like Wikipedia, QualityBox is instantly usable by the end-user. And like Wikipedia, it includes a huge number of configurations, extensions and customizations that make it supremely useful. Greg will take us on a tour of QualityBox, and the MediaWiki ecosystem to illustrate some of the features and capabilities that are available right “out of the box”.</p>
<p>Featuring: - MediaWiki 1.31 LTS - Visual Editor - ElasticSearch (v5.6.10) - Excellent Mobile support - Modern and traditional layouts - New dashboards - Top to Bottom security upgrades - Free SSL certificates - Subdomain-based wiki farms - And LOTS more.</p>
<p>(<em>Narrator: The BLU and Boston.PM wikis were hosted as the demos on QualityBox. Alas the business model fizzled by the end of 2021. It was nice while it lasted. The experimental multi-tenancy MediaWiki was a cool idea.</em>)</p>

<p>They say only Perl can parse Perl, but Perl can also generate Perl. In &quot;Perl begat Perl&quot;, a preview of a talk Uri will present at this year's Perl Conference, he will discuss how you can generate Perl inside Perl and then call eval on the code. Uri will explain why you might want to to use this technique, and illustrate it with good and bad examples.</p>
<p><strong>Uri Guttman</strong> is a founding member of Boston Perl Mongers, a long time presence in the Perl community, and founder/owner of Stem Systems, a Perl consultancy, and known as &quot;The Perl Hunter,&quot; a recruiter specializing in placing Perl talent.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Ricky Morse</strong>, 10 minutes on <code>Set::Tiny</code> <code>Email::Stuffer</code> and <code>Text::CXV_XS</code> <a href="http://pukku.com/bostonpm/2020-09-10minutes/index.html">notes</a></li>
<li>(<em>Narrator: Anyone else remember what they shared? No followups on list.</em>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Where: JITSI</p>
<p>¹ or other compatible, interesting FLOSS too</p>
<p>NOTE – This is as early as 2nd Tuesday can fall and is the day after the long Labor Day Weekend, so it will feel very Monday and not very Tuesday, let alone 2nd Tuesday !</p>
<p>We will use the Jitsi Meet service.</p>
<p>(If you need to hear my rant about why Zoom’s “fixes” are inadequate, ask me off-list.)</p>
<p>Jitsi is a Free/Libre OSS project sponsored by 8x8 (an Atlassian spin-off). It is the freemium base for their added-value corporate meeting &amp; VOIP platform. As FLOSS, it can be self-hosted; they provide a free demo server. We will currently be using the free demo server, but may migrate to a hosted server (where we can set defaults, privileges).</p>
<p>Natick FOSS group has a 4-page Jitsi Help .pdf file, and you can practice beforehand. (Natick meet 1st Thursdays, online, early afternoon) Update to file ^ : Firefox latest versions 78+ support multicast, so are safer than before. Chrome/Chromium/FF78+ all plausible now.</p>
<p>One can use plain web mode, but if you can install the browser plug-in if you like. There are also iOS (iPhone/iPad) and Android apps which work well.</p>
<p>(I will replace this line with the link to the meeting room later)</p>
<p>JITSI scales fine to more people in face-sharing Brady-Bunch / Hollywood Squares mode than you can easily see at once (30ish) and if folks turn off their cameras (same as mikes) when just listening/talking, i.e. when not commenting/presenting, it scales much higher.</p>
<p>(If we later get more folks than will comfortably fit in Jitsi, we can set up a stream to YouTubeLive or some other platform … or upgrade to a proper panelist platform feeding a stream, but the “seminar” quality of Jitsi is fine for our level of anarchy.)</p>
<p>I will routinely mute those not presenting so you’ll usually need to unmute to comment. Hint: Space-bar is push to talk, M is mute/unmute (on phone/tablet it’s the skewmorphic microphone, avoid the handset hangup button!). <a href="https://jitsi.github.io/handbook/docs/user-guide/keyboard-shortcuts">Shortcuts</a></p>

<p><strong>Why you should take a good look at Flutter for all platforms!</strong></p>
<p>Flutter has come a long ways since its was first introduced a few years ago. Yes, even though Google is still in the driver’s seat for Flutter and Dart development, more and more of the contributions are coming from the community.</p>
<p>Google is highly committed to continuing to make Flutter the go-to SDK for user interfaces of all kinds. Of course it still does Mobile well (ios/android/fuchsia), but recently, major releases for Flutter on Web, Flutter on Desktop (linux, windows, macos), and Dart on every platform (including compiling go-like to a single binary with everything included) have continued to please the crowds.</p>
<p>Many large organizations have adopted Flutter, and some app-store apps have had literally millions of downloads.</p>
<p>I’ll be talking about the Past, Present, and Future of Flutter and Dart.</p>
<p>Topics covered:</p>
<p>What is Flutter anyway, and why Dart? How does it compare to other multi-platform UI SDKs? Flutter/Dart – past, present, future Platforms Notable adopters Q&amp;A if there’s time</p>

<h2 id="may-10th-using-perls-twitterapi---bill-r">May 10th Using Perl's Twitter::API - Bill R</h2>
<p>Bill Ricker, inspired by Ricky's talk on archival web scraping last month, revisits the Twitter::API.</p>
<p>One script is a daemon used to automatically retweet useful announcements posted to a monitored Twitter account. The other will archive a Twitter thread in text format (and can safely be re-run when the tread gets longer). It avoids depending on a 3rd party service, which use tracking, ads, and might disappear, to host the archived thread.</p>

<p>&quot;SQLite is an SQL database engine that can be used in applications as a library for quick read-write operations. Unlike other database management systems, SQLite is not a client-server database designed to run in a data center. D. Richard Hipp is the architect and primary author of SQLite and the Fossil SCM.&quot; - <a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2015/11/13/sqlite-with-d-richard-hipp/">S E Daily</a></p>

<h1 id="historical-boilerplate">Historical BOILERPLATE</h1>
<p>(<em>This is the boilerplate as used fall 2020 - spring 2022. Current boilerplate is below announced schedule <a href="index.html#boilerplate">on homepage</a>.</em>)</p>
<ul>
<li>Meetings hosted by Boston.PM are in <a href="https://meet.Jit.si">meet.Jit.si</a> and on 2d Tuesday.</li>
<li>Meetings hosted by <a href="https://www.meetup.com/charlotte-pm/">Charlotte.PM</a> are in Zoom and on Last Wednesdays.</li>
<li>Meetings hosted by Boston Linux Unix (<a href="http://blu.org" class="uri">http://blu.org</a>) are in Jitsi and on 3d Wednesday.</li>
</ul>
<p>(If you need to hear my rant about why Zoom’s “fixes” are inadequate, ask me off-list.) Jitsi is a Free/Libre OSS project sponsored by 8x8 (an Atlassian spin-off). It is the freemium base for their added-value corporate meeting &amp; VOIP platform. As FLOSS, it can be self-hosted; they provide a free demo server. We will currently be using the free demo server, but may migrate to a hosted server (where we can set defaults, privileges). Natick FOSS group has a <a href="http://www.millermicro.com/FOSSUserGroupJitsi.pdf">4-page Jitsi Help .pdf file</a>, and you can practice beforehand. (They meet 1st Thursdays, online, early afternoon.) Update to file ^ : Firefox latest versions 78+ support multicast, so are safer than before. Chrome/Chromium/FF78+ all plausible now.</p>
<p>One can use plain web mode, but you can install the browser plug-in if you like (recommended if sharing slides or terminal). There are also iOS (iPhone/iPad) and Android apps which work well.</p>
<p>JITSI keyboard shortcuts - <a href="https://jitsi.github.io/handbook/docs/user-guide/keyboard-shortcuts" class="uri">https://jitsi.github.io/handbook/docs/user-guide/keyboard-shortcuts</a></p>
<p>JITSI scales fine to more people in face-sharing Brady-Bunch / Hollywood Squares mode than you can easily see at once (30ish) and if folks turn off their cameras when just listening/talking, i.e. when not commenting/presenting, it scales much higher. (If we later get more folks than will comfortably fit in Jitsi, we can set up a stream to YouTubeLive or some other platform … or upgrade to a proper panelist platform feeding a stream, but the “seminar” quality of Jitsi is fine for our level of anarchy.)</p>
<p>I will routinely mute those not presenting so you’ll usually need to unmute to comment. Hint: Space-bar is push to talk, M is mute/unmute (on phone/tablet it’s the skeuomorphic microphone, avoid the handset hangup button!).</p>
<p>As now seen on <a href="https://perlweekly.com/">Perl Weekly newsletter</a> Perl weekly <img src="./images/perl_weekly_234x60.png" alt="234x60.png" id="pwnl" width="117" height="30" /> and their <a href="https://perlweekly.com/events.html">Events Calendar</a> - which you can import via the live <a href="https://perlweekly.com/perlweekly.ical">iCal calendar</a> -- at least in months that i plan ahead (not this month).</p>
