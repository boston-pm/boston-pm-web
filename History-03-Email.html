answer question about the upcoming “Learning Perl 6” book, the
Kickstarter campaign for it, and other things you may want to ask.</p>
<p>About the speaker <strong><em>brian d foy</em></strong> is a long
time member of the Perl community, a prolific Perl trainer, and writer.
In addition to authoring the upcoming <em>Learning Perl 6,</em>† he’s
the the author of <em>Mastering Perl</em>, and co-author of
<em>Programming Perl</em>, <em>Learning Perl</em>, <em>Intermediate
Perl</em>, and <em>Effective Perl Programming</em>. He’s a frequent
speaker at Perl conferences. He founded the first Perl user group, the
<strong>New York Perl mongers,</strong> as well as the Perl advocacy
nonprofit <a href="https://www.pm.org"><strong>Perl
Mongers</strong></a>. A contributor to Perl documentation and maintainer
of several modules on CPAN.</p>
<p>†(<em>Narrator: With the Raku language rename, </em><strong>Learning
Raku</strong>* is now the title of the book. Also, FWIW, “Six things …

highlights of new features and changes in Perl 5.26, including the
potential disruptive change of removing the current directory (.) from
the <span class="citation" data-cites="INC">@INC</span> module search
path. We’ll supplement the slides with the official Perl Delta (change
log) document, and other online sources where more depth is required.
The talk will be an open discussion format, with Bill Ricker leading us
through the slides, but plenty of opportunity for the audience to ask
questions, or offer opinion, and in some cases we’ll try some live demos
of the new features.</p>

<p>Damian Conway, known for his rapid-paced, wide-ranging, tour-de-force
presentations, was the keynote presenter at The Perl Conference, 2017
(formerly known as YAPC::NA). In his keynote he tells “a tale of
madness, obsession, and coding extremity,” describing what it took to
bring 3 keywords from Perl 6 to Perl 5. A community effort that took
three years and 2.8 million lines of code. This is a more extreme
example of what some developers are going through to bring Perl 6
functionality to Perl 5.</p>
<p>We will watch his recorded keynote and discuss among ourselves.</p>
<p>Even if you are new to Perl and don’t follow all the technical

October 10th - GitHub Continuous Integration for Perl CPAN modules</h2>
<p>Tonight (<em>As an emergency substitute talk</em>) we will be having
a mini-hackathon on the <code>Config::Std</code> CPAN module that
Boston.pm maintains. We’ll be offering a live demonstration of setting
up continuous integration (CI) using Travis CI and Appveyor, two hosted
CI tools made freely available for open source projects on GitHub. Join
us as we stumble through the process and learn from our mistakes.</p>
<p>Perl has had <code>Test::Harness</code> for decades, with CPANTS
providing distributed Continuous Integration testing of Released CPAN
module distributions for a decade or more. Thank you CPANTS volunteers
for creating a distributed cloud for us :-). Now GitHub is offering
similar capabilities to all the other FLOSS communities via free
integration with freemium cloud Continuous Integration tools Travis-CI
(for Linux) and Appveyor (for Windows). Since we have CPANTS for
release, we can use Travis-ci&amp;Appveyor to test our DEV branch after
check-in. They’ll even test Pull Requests before merge! Any GitHub FLOSS
project can use these, but Perl CPAN projects can make use easily since
we already have a regression testing culture, we won’t need to write the
tests, just enable them.</p>
<h2 id="nov.-14th---adam-russell-live---deep-learning-in-perl">Nov. 14th
- Adam Russell (live!) - “Deep Learning in Perl”</h2>
<p><strong>LIVE Speaker !</strong></p>
<p><em>Remember, if you get Veterans’ Day Monday off work, Tuesday will
feel like Monday.</em></p>
<p><strong>“Deep Learning with AI::MXNet: Navigating implementation
issues”</strong></p>
<p>ABSTRACT This talk will cover lessons learned from a recent
experience in getting a deep learning projected started, with little
prior experience in AI. All code will use the Perl MXNet API and guide
the audience through developing a simple model, which is then built on
to perform more complex tasks.</p>
<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) has for a long time captured the popular
imagination. Results from academia and industry have finally started to
deliver on some of the long hoped for results: self driving cars,
automated medical diagnoses, and written and verbal language processing.
These areas are showing advances that were once simply products of
fiction writers. The current wave of AI enthusiasm may be attributed to
what is called Deep Learning which is a convenient label for relatively
new techniques using neural networks. The possibility for increased
automation across virtually every industry has resulted in the spinning
up of many new startup companies, as well as new projects within
existing enterprises, resulting in the need to develop the skills
necessary to pursue this new area.</p>
<p>While not the language of production, Perl is used to develop
algorithms and demonstrate concepts before they receive fuller
treatment. Deep Learning practitioners often begin their deep learning
work, correctly, with a review of the literature and research into the
fundamentals. Projects then often start confidently with high hopes,
built on that conceptual understanding, only to quickly get bogged down
in unforeseen, but critically important, issues of implementation.</p>
<p><strong>Adam Russell</strong> is a software engineer with OptumLabs’
Center for Applied Data Science (CADS). CADS is tasked with developing
prototype applications which implement recent advances in algorithms and
technology to address issues of importance to Optum business interests.
Most recent projects have been focused on Deep Learning. Adam has a PhD
in Computer Science from the University of Massachusetts Lowell, his
academic interests involve Computational Geometry and Data Visualization
and these explorations, much like the work described in this talk, are
all Perl driven. He also teaches, on an adjunct basis, at Wentworth
Institute of Technology in Boston.</p>

13th 2nd Tuesday – Commercial Game Design with Modern Perl – Ovid builds
a MMORPG in Perl</h2>
<p><em>topic originally scheduled for January</em></p>
<p><strong>Amsterdam Perl Conference 2017 video screening</strong></p>
<p>Noted Perl personality <strong>Ovid (Curtis Poe)</strong> has built a
Space-exploration on-line role-playing-game called “Tau Station” in
Perl. It’s even a business. In this talk, he describes the games
industry and how Modern Perl makes building his game fun.</p>
<p>Original Abstract -</p>
<p>“With Tau Station, we’re building a sci-fi universe in a browser.
However, in object oriented design, what does the”single responsibility
principle” mean when your combat armor serves as armor, a weapon, and
medkit?</p>
<p>“And when many different behaviors have long chains of duplicated
requirements (for example, do you have enough money to buy a medkit, or
refuel your ship, or repair your blaster, or bribe a guard), how do you
handle that in an efficient an easy to read manner?</p>
<p>“And how do you avoid god objects when your character in the universe
drives almost everything?</p>
<p>“This talk explores some of the techniques we’ve developed for Tau
Station to easily model complex behaviors.”</p>
<p>We’ll have our usual community discussion after (or by hitting pause
as needed) in lieu of speaker Q&amp;A.</p>

<p>or, <strong><em>Ringing halfsheets with Perl 6</em></strong></p>
<p><em>Meetings resume ! September at the usual place</em></p>
<p>After ringing a bell for 45 minutes to 3 hours, you kind of want
people to know you did it, and what you did it for. Ricky uses Perl 6 to
replace a manual process for creating “half-sheets” to post in the Old
North ringing room, for tourists to see.</p>
<p>Ricky sensibly doesn’t want to retype or copy-paste what’s already
somewhere on-line, so he uses Perl 6 to pull the data from a database as
XML, and then typeset the half sheets. This is using <strong>Perl6, <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groff_%28software%29">GROFF</a>,</strong>
and <strong>C6PAN Modules</strong> <code>Template::Mustache</code>,
<code>XML::XPath</code>, and <code>HTTP::User Agent</code>.</p>

<p>Moderator: <strong>Greg Rundlett,</strong> founder of eQuality
Technology</p>
<p><strong>A guided tour of QualityBox, a MediaWiki hosting
service</strong></p>
<p>Abstract:</p>
<p>Greg Rundlett, founder of eQuality Technology, has created a hosted
software service called QualityBox which is provides the wiki engine
(MediaWiki) that drives Wikipedia. Like Wikipedia, QualityBox is
instantly usable by the end-user. And like Wikipedia, it includes a huge
number of configurations, extensions and customizations that make it
supremely useful. Greg will take us on a tour of QualityBox, and the
MediaWiki ecosystem to illustrate some of the features and capabilities
that are available right “out of the box”.</p>
<p>Featuring: - MediaWiki 1.31 LTS - Visual Editor - ElasticSearch
(v5.6.10) - Excellent Mobile support - Modern and traditional layouts -
New dashboards - Top to Bottom security upgrades - Free SSL certificates
- Subdomain-based wiki farms - And LOTS more.</p>
<p>(<em>Narrator: The BLU and Boston.PM wikis were hosted as the demos
on QualityBox. Alas the business model fizzled by the end of 2021. It
was nice while it lasted. The experimental multi-tenancy MediaWiki was a
cool idea.</em>)</p>

Bill Ricker</h2>
<p><strong>Hue-Saturation-Luminance for Ack3 with Convert::Color::HSL
and Term::ANSIColor</strong></p>
<p>Curious about how to handle different color spaces in Perl?</p>
<p><strong>Bill Ricker</strong> will show how he improved RBG palette
help for <a href="https://beyondgrep.com"><strong>Ack3</strong></a>
using the HSL colorspace model and CPAN module that does HSL&lt;-&gt;RGB
transform.</p>
<p>Ack uses an module <a
href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Term::ANSIColor"><strong><code>Term::ANSIColor</code></strong></a>
that uses base-6 colors from 000 to 555 .
<code>ack --help-rgb-colors</code> will display all possible colors. The
palette display was formerly laid-out as convenient for the code loop,
not for the viewer’s comprehension.</p>
<p>Reorganizing it according to a geometric color model makes it easier
to see the various gradients between color coordinates. <strong>Bill
Ricker</strong> used <a
href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Convert::Color::HSL"><strong><code>Convert::Color::HSL</code></strong></a>
to prototype a new palette-help, as seen in new <a
href="https://github.com/beyondgrep/ack3/blob/dev/dev/generate-rgb-codes.pl">Ack3
code</a>.</p>
<p><em>The HSL model is very similar to the HSV model, with subtle
distinction between “Luminance” and “Value” in the third, vertical
coordinate:</em></p>

11, E51-376 (Back to 3rd Floor) ¨Perl begat Perl¨ - Uri Guttman</h2>
<p>They say only Perl can parse Perl, but Perl can also generate Perl.
In “<strong><em>Perl begat Perl</em></strong>”, a preview of a talk Uri
will present at this year’s Perl Conference, he will discuss how you can
generate Perl inside Perl and then call eval on the code. Uri will
explain why you might want to to use this technique, and illustrate it
with good and bad examples.</p>
<p><strong>Uri Guttman</strong> is a founding member of Boston Perl
Mongers, a long time presence in the Perl community, and founder/owner
of Stem Systems, a Perl consultancy, and known as “The Perl Hunter,” a
recruiter specializing in placing Perl talent.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMW1hCpP2Is">TPC Video of
same talk</a> has abstract -</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Have you ever wondered why some CPAN modules actually generate Perl
code to be eval’ed? Some of the reasons are simplicity but most often it
is for getting faster running code. The key Perl feature used is eval on
strings (the dangerous eval, not the safe eval of blocks). Newbies are
always warned not to use string eval but this talk will show you why and
how to use it for your benefit. Simple and common examples will be shown
that anyone can use. Then more complex examples from existing CPAN
modules (two of which are by the speaker) will be covered. They use Perl
code generation for major speed gains (including 4x in one case).</p>

<li>(<em>Narrator: Anyone else remember what they shared? No followups

</ul>
<p>Where: JITSI</p>
<p>¹ or other compatible, interesting FLOSS too</p>
<p>NOTE – This is as early as 2nd Tuesday can fall and is the day after
the long Labor Day Weekend, so it will feel very Monday and not very
Tuesday, let alone 2nd Tuesday !</p>
<p>We will use the Jitsi Meet service.</p>
<p>(If you need to hear my rant about why Zoom’s “fixes” are inadequate,
ask me off-list.)</p>
<p>Jitsi is a Free/Libre OSS project sponsored by 8x8 (an Atlassian
spin-off). It is the freemium base for their added-value corporate
meeting &amp; VOIP platform. As FLOSS, it can be self-hosted; they
provide a free demo server. We will currently be using the free demo
server, but may migrate to a hosted server (where we can set defaults,
privileges).</p>
<p>Natick FOSS group has a 4-page Jitsi Help .pdf file, and you can
practice beforehand. (Natick meet 1st Thursdays, online, early
afternoon) Update to file ^ : Firefox latest versions 78+ support
multicast, so are safer than before. Chrome/Chromium/FF78+ all plausible
now.</p>
<p>One can use plain web mode, but if you can install the browser
plug-in if you like. There are also iOS (iPhone/iPad) and Android apps
which work well.</p>
<p>(I will replace this line with the link to the meeting room
later)</p>
<p>JITSI scales fine to more people in face-sharing Brady-Bunch /
Hollywood Squares mode than you can easily see at once (30ish) and if
folks turn off their cameras (same as mikes) when just
listening/talking, i.e. when not commenting/presenting, it scales much
higher.</p>
<p>(If we later get more folks than will comfortably fit in Jitsi, we
can set up a stream to YouTubeLive or some other platform … or upgrade
to a proper panelist platform feeding a stream, but the “seminar”
quality of Jitsi is fine for our level of anarchy.)</p>
<p>I will routinely mute those not presenting so you’ll usually need to
unmute to comment. Hint: Space-bar is push to talk, M is mute/unmute (on
phone/tablet it’s the skewmorphic microphone, avoid the handset hangup
button!). <a

27th (Wednesday) - Cross-platform Flutter - Joint with Charlotte PM -
Randal L Schwartz</h2>
<p><strong>Why you should take a good look at Flutter for all
platforms!</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://flutter.dev"><strong>Flutter</strong></a> has come a
long ways since its was first introduced a few years ago. Yes, even
though Google is still in the driver’s seat for Flutter and Dart
development, more and more of the contributions are coming from the
community.</p>
<p>Google is highly committed to continuing to make Flutter the go-to
SDK for user interfaces of all kinds. Of course it still does Mobile
well (ios/android/fuchsia), but recently, major releases for Flutter on
Web, Flutter on Desktop (linux, windows, macos), and Dart on every
platform (including compiling go-like to a single binary with everything
included) have continued to please the crowds.</p>
<p>Many large organizations have adopted Flutter, and some app-store
apps have had literally millions of downloads.</p>
<p>I’ll be talking about the <strong>Past, Present, and Future of
Flutter and Dart.</strong></p>
<p>Topics covered:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is Flutter anyway, and why Dart?</li>
<li>How does it compare to other multi-platform UI SDKs?</li>
<li>Flutter/Dart – past, present, future</li>
<li>Platforms Notable adopters</li>
<li>Q&amp;A if there’s time</li>

<p>(If you need to hear my rant about why Zoom’s “fixes” are inadequate,
ask me off-list.) Jitsi is a Free/Libre OSS project sponsored by 8x8 (an
Atlassian spin-off). It is the freemium base for their added-value
corporate meeting &amp; VOIP platform. As FLOSS, it can be self-hosted;
they provide a free demo server. We will currently be using the free
demo server, but may migrate to a hosted server (where we can set
defaults, privileges). Natick FOSS group has a <a

<p>JITSI scales fine to more people in face-sharing Brady-Bunch /
Hollywood Squares mode than you can easily see at once (30ish) and if
folks turn off their cameras when just listening/talking, i.e. when not
commenting/presenting, it scales much higher. (If we later get more
folks than will comfortably fit in Jitsi, we can set up a stream to
YouTubeLive or some other platform … or upgrade to a proper panelist
platform feeding a stream, but the “seminar” quality of Jitsi is fine
for our level of anarchy.)</p>
<p>I will routinely mute those not presenting so you’ll usually need to
unmute to comment. Hint: Space-bar is push to talk, M is mute/unmute (on

of <strong>smol</strong> – a site showcasing painted miniatures –
leveraging <strong>sveltekit</strong>, <strong>svelte-query</strong>,
<strong>openapi</strong> and <strong>JSON:API</strong> to achieve

February 14th 💘 , 6:30 PM 🇺🇸 Boston PM: <code>match::smart</code>,
<code>match::simple</code> - Toby Inkster (live)</h2>
<p>With P5P actively moving forward from deprecation to Warning and
eventual removal of the v5.10 SmartMatch <code>~~</code> operator – for
good reason, it was underspecified, nondeterministic, and outright
dangerious – there’s a question for those who found a subset of its
capabilities useful. Prolific module author <a
href="https://metacpan.org/author/TOBYINK">Toby Inkster</a> provides a
safe, deterministic subset of smart-match in <a
href="https://metacpan.org/dist/match-simple"><code>match-simple</code></a>
distribution which provides <a
href="https://metacpan.org/pod/match::simple"><code>match::simple</code></a>
and <a
href="https://metacpan.org/pod/match::smart"><code>match::smart</code></a>
with optional <a href="https://metacpan.org/dist/match-simple-XS">XS
accelerator</a>.</p>
<p>(<em>with apologies to anyone who has other plans that 💘 evening.
this is the risk of 2d Tuesday scheduling.</em>)</p>
<p><strong>Toby Inkster</strong> is a consultant for The Perl Shop. He
has been working as a software developer for over 20 years, focusing on
databases, the Web, and the places where they overlap. Toby has
contributed to popular Perl open source libraries such as the
light-weight object-oriented programming tool Moo, as well as being the
lead developer of Type::Tiny. He has an interest in the Semantic Web was
an invited expert to the W3C RDFa Working Group. He also enjoys cooking
and likes cats.</p>
<p><code>match::simple</code> and <code>match::smart</code> are
survivable substitutes for the deprecated <code>~~</code> smartmatch
operator, either as a fake operator or as a callable routine renamed to
caller’s convenience. The ‘simple’ variant has predictable semantics;
the ‘smart’ variant emulates (nearly) the full inconceivable complexity
of the deprecated <code>~~</code>, which provide a survival path for
some code.</p>
<pre><code>use v5.10;
use match::simple;
 
if ( $this |M| $that ) {
   say &quot;$this matches $that&quot;;
}</code></pre>
<p>When asked if he also provided a substitute for the
<code>given ... when ...</code> keywords, he replied not currently
(syntax module he’d used has been deprecated), but it’s not hard to do,

exciting news: P5P’s upcoming development release Perl 5.37.9
(alpha/beta for 5.40.0) will contain<br />

It has been merged.</p>
<p>Ovid is the architect and Paul is the lead developer for adding a new
object-oriented system called Corinna† (formerly &amp; confusingly “Cor”

RFC or proposal and prototype, but until recently, without commitment
for the Perl 5 Porters (P5P) to actually implement it in Perl 5. Over
the summer, P5P have approved the initial Stage 1 integration into Perl
Core. While we’ve had 20+ years of new OO packages for Perl5 since 5.0,
this is the first actual (as opposed to proposed) overhaul of the

id="using-mp3tag-syntaxkeywordtry-etc-to-make-playable-audio-archives-with-legible-titles">Using

<p>This <a href="./scripts/mp3info.pl.html">script (Tidy html)</a> (<a
href="./scripts/mp3info.pl"><code>mp3info.pl</code> (raw)</a>) exists to
(a) scratch an immediate itch and (b) experiment with a few modules. No
claim is made to best usage of any of these features! The Itch was
scratched, and pudding was proofed.</p>
<p>The Itch was that in moving old podcast files off a modest M.2 SSD to
archival spinning rust drive (which is normally kept Read-only mounted
for safety), I did not want to rely on Rhythmbox or other music/pod
player being sane about browsing/playing a read-only drive where it
couldn’t mark things PLAYED. I did need to move most of my older mp3,
ogg, etc collection that wasn’t “in queue” to larger passive storage to
make space. But i didn’t want to lose the ability to search by track
title etc, which usually aren’t fully encoded in filenames. As i
expected, there’s a CPAN module for accessing mp3 etc meta-data tags. So
it should be trivial to recursively write HTML indices for directories
containing MP3s, with links that will play a file, right?</p>

<a
href="https://metacpan.org/release/DAVECROSS/Amazon-Sites-0.1.6/source/README.md">0.1.6</a>

syntax</a> (via the compatible wrapper <a
href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Feature::Compat::Class">Feature::Compat::Class</a>)
and <code>signatures</code> to make a real-world useful CPAN ojbect
using latest Perl features. Dave Cross got some help in FB “The Perl
Community” :</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Dave Cross</strong><br />
I released a new CPAN module called <code>Amazon::Sites</code>. It uses
<code>Feature::Compat::Class</code> and subroutine signatures. And CPAN
testers tells me that it is failing to compile on Perl 5.24. It looks
like the failure is because of my use of signatures - but they were
introduced in Perl 5.20, so I can’t see what the problem is.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Leon Timmermans</strong><br />
Yeah, if you want to use signatures in <code>Object::Pad</code> methods
you need 5.26. This issue is not solvable as earlier perls don’t provide
the underlaying primitives needed to implement this.</p>

<p><strong>Joshua S. Day</strong><br />
@ <strong>Dave Cross</strong> I notice that you have a class inside a
package by the same name. Is there a reason the whole file isn’t just a
class?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Dave Cross</strong> Author Admin<br />
<strong>Joshua S. Day</strong> It’s because the <code>PAUSE</code>
indexer hasn’t kept up with the new OO syntax and doesn’t (yet)
recognise the “class” keyword as introducing a package. See
https://github.com/andk/pause/issues/436 … My first attempt at uploading
the module failed for this reason. I got email from <strong>Neil
Bowers</strong> explaining the problem and he raised the ticket above.
I’m not expecting anything to change until after the Perl Toolchain
Summit next month</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s a very simple set of 2 classes (a collection class and a
single-thing instances class) that solves a real problem without needing
features that aren’t in the experimental core <code>feature class</code>
yet.</p>

<p>And we of course compared our <strong>Eclipse experiences</strong>
the prior day. I (Bill) opted for 97% in Mom’s driveway — celebrating
memory of her taking me to Grandfather’s for Eclipse of 1963 — and
concentrated on the experience rather than photography but got a <a
href="https://pixelfed.social/i/web/post/683385129870968035">few
photos</a>. I got 140 minutes between 1st and 4th contact. The 3%
Maximum period was perhaps longer than Totality for those there, and was
differently fascinating; the remnant sliver seemingly rotated
<strong>around</strong> the shadow as the shadow slowly shifted across
the sun’s disk from pseudo-2nd-contact to pseudo-3rd-contact. NASA
posted an image showing this from <a
