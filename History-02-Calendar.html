<p>A mutually-guided tour of the first half of several Perl-ish Advent Calendars <a href="./documents/Xmas-Lights.pdf"><img src="./images/XmasLights33.png" alt="XmasLights33.png" /></a></p>
<p>Around this time of year there is a tradition in the programming communities to share our favorite libraries, tools, and tips we've gathered over the past year. These prizes are dolled out once per day in classic Advent Calendar style. In the next Boston.pm meeting we'll take a look at the highlights from several in-progress Perl-related calendars, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Perl Advent (classic Perl 5)</li>
<li>Perl6 Advent</li>
<li>Dancer</li>
<li>C::Blocks Advent (a whole calendar for a single module in Beta !?)</li>
</ul>
<p>and maybe more from the master list via <a href="http://www.lenjaffe.com/AdventPlanet/2016/index.html">Advent Planet</a>which has other languages and sysadmin, perf, ..., and a code based puzzles.</p>
<p>(Audience participation: As usual, our Greek chorus answers each other's questions about the modules seen.)</p>

<p>Last month, I did my usual Cryptographic History talk before BLU.org's GPG/PGP key-signing. The title was &quot;<em>Transposition Cyphers in Historic Context</em>&quot;, looking at a theory and two specific uses, President Lincoln and German Army Corps WW1. As usual, there was a bit of Perl code used for demonstration - for Lincoln's.</p>
<p>This time, I used the 5.020 experimental features, <strong><code>postderef</code></strong> and <strong><code>signatures,</code></strong> that we've discussed in new release feature reviews (both promoted to stable in 5.024, so safe to use in real code).</p>

<p>I stumbled on a link to a set of posts and hand-drawn <a href="https://wizardzines.com/"><strong>'zines'</strong></a> about Linux debugging and 'doing' software at . The Linux Debugging zine includes several 'old friend' tools (which gives me confidence in this person's opinions) and also included new or new to me options and tools, and specifically enthused over <strong>Brendan Gregg's invention: FlameGraphs.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Brendan Gregg</strong> invented these to make sense of profile stack samples of MySQL, which produced so much data that he had to invent a new way to visualize ... with Perl, naturally. Tim Bunce has bundled and enhanced FlameGraphs into CPAN NYTProf, but it's usable with any profiler giving full stack traces with symbols (Dtrace, perf, SystemTrap, OS X Instruments, Xperf.exe, NYTProf for Perl). -Bill Ricker</p>
<p>We will watch a video by the author and play with the source code.</p>

<p>(By the magic of video - Yapc::EU)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Performance has long been one of the blockers to greater adoption of Perl 6. The language is designed in expectation of a sufficiently smart optimizer, knowing that such things are possible - but setting quite a challenge for those of us working on Perl 6 implementation. Following the &quot;make it work, then make it fast&quot; approach, we've done a lot of work over the years on getting many language features to work well in Rakudo. ... In this session I'll discuss how we've been improving Perl 6 performance by working at all levels of the implementation: optimizing built-ins, improving the Perl 6 optimizer's ability to simplify code, and building a powerful dynamic optimizer for MoarVM that uses run-time information about a program's typical behavior to cheapen attribute accesses, resolve dispatches, eliminate type checks, perform inlining, and much more. I'll also take a look at the MoarVM JIT project, and how that is helping.</p>

<div class="figure">

<p class="caption">benchmark</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Finally, I'll take stock of where we're at so far using latest benchmark results: what we can do about as well as Perl 5, where Perl 5 comes out faster, and where Rakudo Perl 6 comes out ahead.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Parallelism and concurrency are different, though often confused. Asynchrony adds yet another concept into the mix. And there are dozens of different approaches to working with these concepts. How do we identify what kind of problem we're dealing with, and pick an approach to solving it? &quot;In this session, I'll look at a range of different problems - some parallel, some concurrent - and show the approaches that may be taken to solve them. And, since I've been working on the Perl 6 parallelism and concurrency features, I'll show how these solutions look in Perl 6.&quot;</p>

<p>This month Boston.pm presents a recorded talk by <strong>Ovid (Curtis Poe)</strong> with live code examples prepared and demonstrated by Bill Ricker. Ovid describes his talk as, &quot;<a href="http://perl6.org/">Perl 6</a> is a great language, but sometimes the enthusiasts talk about the crazy, scary things you can do with it. In this talk, I discuss how easy it is to really use.&quot;</p>
<p>We'll have working examples in live Perl6 (<a href="http://rakudo.org/how-to-get-rakudo/">Rakudo Perl 6</a>), both copied from the main presentation to play with immediately on our screen, for kibitzing and tinkering, plus some other examples to try.</p>
<p>Program notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>We're planning to have several <a href="http://perl6.org/">Perl 6</a> talks this Fall/Winter, building up to the Perl 6 formal release at Christmas, including:
<ul>
<li>P6 Regex &amp; Grammars</li>
<li>P6 Concurrency and Asynchrony</li>
<li>If you have any Perl 6 code to share, maybe as a mini talk before main talk, or as an intermission, if it fits with a scheduled p6 talk!</li>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bq4B6m3a0H8">Video</a>(youtube) [[file/view/Net__AMQP__RabbitMQ Presentation/543820114/Net__AMQP__RabbitMQ Presentation|Slides]] (pdf)</p>
<p><strong>Mike Stemle, Jr.</strong> discusses his experiences at ThinkGeek working on and using <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Net::AMQP::RabbitMQ">Net::AMQP::RabbitMQ</a>, an interface library to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RabbitMQ">RabbitMQ</a> , an open source message broker that implements the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP).</p>
<p>Being a Perl Shop is hard sometimes, and as a result you sometimes miss out on some of the super-awesome third party support that other - some would say, weaker (but of course we wouldn’t say that, we’re classy) - languages enjoy. So I had to get my hands dirty. As such, I contributed to the development of the Net::AMQP::RabbitMQ module so that we at ThinkGeek could properly integrate our Perl applications with this MQ server.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/tutorials/amqp-concepts.html"><img src="./images/RabbitMQ-example-routing.png" alt="RabbitMQ example routing" /></a></p>
<p>I will walk you through a very high level of the integration itself, some of the challenges we faced, and how we overcame them. I’ll also go through some of the improvements I’ve made as part of the team of people maintaining the Net::AMQP::RabbitMQ module. <strong>BEWARE</strong>, however, this talk is not for the squeamish. There will be guts. perlguts, and they’ll be everywhere.</p>

<p>Hive provides a SQL-like interface to Hadoop. Perl can interoperate with Hive in a variety of ways, including Hive queries through a Thrift API and the direct incorporation of Perl into map-reduce jobs. The author has taken a few baby steps on this journey and chooses to share the results with his peers.</p>
<p>KEYWORDS: Perl, Hadoop, Hive, Big Data, Thrift, Map-Reduce.</p>
<p>This meeting is being hosted by EIG, Sean and Charles's employer. (A carpool from MIT and/or Red Line will be available for Car-Free commuters, talk to Bill.)</p>
<p>(If you can't attend in person, this talk will be broadcast live via <a href="https://plus.google.com/events/c00ofh438nl4forf29v3df8ubio">Hangouts</a> / <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?%20v=HF_l8fhOPWw">YouTube</a> and you can submit questions via IRC or Hangouts Q&amp;A.)</p>

<p class="caption">Shellshock bug logo</p>
</div>
<p>We will examine the implications for the ShellShock BASH bug for Perl -- it's much wider than just about BASH CGI or even Perl CGI scripts -- and also a recently discovered/fixed but comparably long-lurking Perl DoS bug in a core module (Data::Dumper stack smash CVE-2014-4330) and how is it possibly remotely triggerable.</p>
<p>The good news is ShellShocker was slightly over-hyped; unlike Heartbleed, this one does NOT generally affect the Internet of Things. Your Internet-enabled toaster is likely immune. But Windows and Mac are not entirely immune to this Linux bug.</p>
<h2 id="september-2014---creating-and-managing-a-private-cpan-with-pinto-stratopan-jeffrey-thalhammer">September, 2014 - Creating And Managing a Private CPAN with Pinto &amp; Stratopan <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~thaljef/">Jeffrey Thalhammer</a></h2>
<p>If you use Perl, then you have probably wrestled with CPAN. Shifting dependencies, incompatible interfaces, and test failures in CPAN modules can suddenly break your application, leaving your team to chase bugs they didn't create. But managing CPAN modules doesn't have to be painful. A private CPAN repository gives you a stable platform for making consistent builds and managing upgrades for all your Perl modules.</p>
<p>In this session, you'll learn how to use <strong><a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Pinto">Pinto</a></strong> to create a private CPAN and build your applications with the right modules, every time. You'll learn about the dangers of the public CPAN and how a private CPAN can help mitigate those risks. Finally, we'll cover some of the newest features of Pinto and show you a few power-user tricks to get your private CPAN up and running quickly.</p>
<p><a href="https://stratopan.com/about">Stratopan</a> is a startup founded by the speaker that provides &quot;Private CPAN repositories securely hosted in the cloud.&quot; So Pinto is the tool that facilitates creating a private repository, and Stratopan lets you outsource the hosting of that repository.</p>

<p>A collection of the speaker's lightening talks, in the spirit of a highlight reel. We replayed a recording of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG4fQUrkyK8">Ricardo's talk to NY.pm</a>, after which Ricardo joined us by tele-presense for <strong>live Q&amp;A</strong> .)</p>
<p>Some talks carefully guide the listeners through the entirety of a topic, starting with the basics and ending with the fine details. That's… not the plan for this talk. Instead, we're going to see the highlight reel of a bunch of topics that caught my interest over the course of the year: a review of cool (and uncool) changes in Perl, the best modules you're not using, stupid optimization tricks, tools for handling catastrophic program failure, git scripts you'll become dependent on, numbers stations, Zork, productivity tools, and who knows what else.</p>
<p>I will stand in place and let lightning talks strike over and over, until I am reduced to cinders.</p>
<p>You get to witness the ordeal, and you might just learn a thing or two.</p>

<h2 id="january-2014---deduplication-hackathon---panel">January, 2014 - Deduplication Hackathon - Panel</h2>
<p>A recap of the DFW Perl Mongers Deduplication Hackathon</p>
<p>SPEAKERS: <strong>Joel Berger, Tommy Butler, Yanick Champoux, Bruce Gray, Tim King</strong></p>
<p>MODERATOR: <strong>Tom Metro</strong></p>
<p>How fast can Perl find duplicate files on a 100 GB file system? That's the question the <strong>Dallas/Fort Worth Perl Monger's Winter 2013 Deduplication Hackathon</strong> set out to answer. There were a diverse range of contest entries, from the expected procedural Perl 5 code to ones that used Moose, MOP, and even one Perl 6 entry.</p>
<p>Tom Metro will moderate a collection of prerecorded and live lightning talks by the contestants. After a brief intro, we'll hear from Bruce on his 6-line Perl 6 entry, from Tim (live in person) with his comprehensive MOP based solution, from Joel with a classic Perl 5 procedural solution, from Yanick with the officially winning solution built with Moose (yes, the fastest used Moose!), and lastly from the DFW.pm leader and contest organizer Tommy (live via Google Hangout) with his unofficial Moose based solution, that post-contest, was further tuned to beat everyone. Lastly, we'd like to hear from the audience what you'd like to see as the topic of a future hackathon.</p>
<p>If you couldn't make it to the meeting, you can find most of the materials online.</p>
<p>The original <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvqqRFGMZS0">DFW.pm meeting recording</a>.</p>
<p>You'll find Bruce Gray's Perl 6 entry discussed at time range 17:29 - 35:30. Joel Berger, who won for lowest memory, fewest lines of code, and best <strong>Perl::Critic</strong> score, introduces himself at 10:54 - 12:48, and then discusses his code at 1:06:10 - 1:21:01.</p>
<p>Tim, who won for <strong>best documentation, most features, and best effort,</strong> discusses his code after Bruce, but I don't have the time index.</p>
<p>In a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MNuNupAvvg">separate video</a>, Yanick Champoux, the winner for fastest run time, discusses his code.</p>
<p>Tommy Butler, the contest organizer, discussed his unofficial entry towards the end of the first video above. (At the Boston.pm meeting he elaborated on some of the optimizations he added post-contest, leading to a design that beats Yanick by 40 seconds.)</p>

<p>In 2011 I started working on a project to improve the object system in Perl 5. I wanted to take elements from Moose, as well as bring in some more elements of the Perl 6 object system. The first version of this work ended up suffocating under its own complexity, but after this year's YAPC::NA I decided to come back to the project with a fresh perspective and so far work is progressing very well.</p>
<p>In this talk I will walk through several examples of the proposed syntax and feature set as well as discuss some of the underlying implementation details. This will be an interactive talk and audience members are encouraged to ask questions, poke holes in the design and help improve the proposal.</p>

<p><strong>Bill Ricker</strong> and <strong>Tom Metro</strong> (<em>remotely</em>)</p>
<p>Boston.pm adopted one of Damian's PBP modules, Config::Std. It was broken by Perl 5.18's security patch to randomize hash ordering. Debian Unstable reported the [https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=85956 bug] (glad to know they're doing Perl 5.18 and packaging Config::Std!) and provided a patch. Ricky made sure the patch didn't invalidate Damian's design.<br /> <br /></p>

<p>Q “There is a question that the slides don't address which I am curious about -- why didn't you just use Java &amp; Java-based languages?</p>
<p>A. “each had major existing workflow in perl.one needed to fetch data only available with java api, other needed algorithm only with java api.”</p>
<p>A. “Exactly. Our ORM is in Perl. :Also, I did in 1 file of Perl what Java would require in 10s. The need to maintain simplicity was important for my group. You have to follow the business requirements laid before you. A lot of my group writes Perl. The rest of engineering writing the customer facing stuff writes in Java. We mainly communicate over a database (read: not realtime). But there is the occasional bleed over from Java land that we have to implement the exact same code on our end as which ships in the product. But our framework is (largely) Perl. So we glue the 2 together. And as engineers, &quot;good enough&quot; is perfect.</p>
<p>Some data points for &quot;good enough:&quot;</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>I can scan a Maven repo for updates in under an hour</p></li>
<li><p>I can apply a in-house algorithm to a directory structure in sub-second time”</p></li>

<p>&quot;PDL is the Perl Data Language, a perl extension that is designed for scientific and bulk numeric data processing and display. It extends perl's syntax and includes fully vectorized, multidimensional array handling, plus several paths for device-independent graphics output. &quot;PDL is fast, comparable and often outperforming IDL and MATLAB in real world applications. PDL allows large N-dimensional data sets such as large images, spectra, etc to be stored efficiently and manipulated quickly.&quot;</p>

<p>CGI refactored before and after</p>
<p>As many of you have known and seen, Uri Guttman will do code review on the fly with anyone's code on display at pm meetings. This may seem frivolous or whatever but it is can be useful in many cases. He has a client for his Perl support/training services which entails lots of code and design review and it has proven very valuable to this shop. He has obtained permission to show one CGI script in its before any review state and after much review and refactoring. The author of the script did almost all of the editing and rewriting but for one sub rewrite that Uri did because it was more complex than the author could handle. The script went through 14 revisions and it still isn't where it should be (that means using a proper template module like Template::Simple) but it is light years from where it was. This talk is being called before/after. You will see some of the worst coding and template practices ever unleashed at a Boston.pm gathering. You will be in shock at the use of globals, the lack of subs, and the redundant everything everywhere. Then the tranquility of the after version will calm your senses, sooth your jangled nerves and show you there really can be order in this chaotic universe. Be prepared for coding hell and heaven! Fun is guaranteed for all!</p>

We will take a quick look at scripting the managed clients, then we delve into programming the Landscape API to script automation tasks from the shell, in effect, scripting the server, and how this allows custom integration of multiple tools.</p>

<p>&quot;Rumors of my death are greatly exaggerated&quot; -- Mark Twain</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Curious what the Perl community has been up to lately? Come see Perl 6's recent preview release.</p>
<p>Since July, Perl Mongers groups around the world are doing demo nights to build and exercise Rakudo Star. Boston.PM's turn is September 14th, MIT E51-376 7:30pm (refreshments in hallway at 7). {This is the night before BLU's PGP night, second Tuesday is as late as it gets this month.} We'll install it and show what it can do. We may discuss what more the final release candidate will do, and if enough non-regulars turn up, we can discuss what's in 5.12 that's not in the 5.8.4 or older that's still on many commercial Unix systems</p>

<p>Announce: Rakudo Star - a useful, usable, &quot;early adopter&quot; distribution of Perl 6<br />
Submitted by pmichaud on Thu, 07/29/2010 - 05:18</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>On behalf of the Rakudo and Perl 6 development teams, I'm happy to announce the July 2010 release of &quot;Rakudo Star&quot;, a useful and usable distribution of Perl 6.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Rakudo Star is aimed at &quot;early adopters&quot; of Perl 6. We know that it still has some bugs, it is far slower than it ought to be, and there are some advanced pieces of the Perl 6 language specification that aren't implemented yet. But Rakudo Perl 6 in its current form is also proving to be viable (and fun) for developing applications and exploring a great new language. These &quot;Star&quot; releases are intended to make Perl 6 more widely available to programmers, grow the Perl 6 codebase, and gain additional end-user feedback about the Perl 6 language and Rakudo's implementation of it.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In the Perl 6 world, we make a distinction between the language (&quot;Perl 6&quot;) and specific implementations of the language such as &quot;Rakudo Perl&quot;. &quot;Rakudo Star&quot; is a distribution that includes release #31 of the Rakudo Perl 6 compiler, version 2.6.0 of the Parrot Virtual Machine, and various modules, documentation, and other resources collected from the Perl 6 community. We plan to make Rakudo Star releases on a monthly schedule, with occasional special releases in response to important bugfixes or changes.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Some of the many cool Perl 6 features that are available in this release of Rakudo Star:</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>* Perl 6 grammars and regexes
* formal parameter lists and signatures
* metaoperators
* gradual typing
* a powerful object model, including roles and classes
* lazy list evaluation
* multiple dispatch
* smart matching
* junctions and autothreading
* operator overloading (limited forms for now)
* introspection
* currying
* a rich library of builtin operators, functions, and types
* an interactive read-evaluation-print loop
* Unicode at the codepoint level
* resumable exceptions</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>There are some key features of Perl 6 that Rakudo Star does not yet handle appropriately, although they will appear in upcoming releases. Thus, we do not consider Rakudo Star to be a &quot;Perl 6.0.0&quot; or &quot;1.0&quot; release. ...</p>

<li>Getting started (~25 min)</li>
<li>Working alone with git (~20 min)</li>
<li>Working with others with git, the traditional way (~20 min)</li>

<p>&quot;I am using Perl glue to put together a cheap and small Linux NAS from the Western Digital MyBook II - there are a bunch of hackers doing this, but I wanted mine to have a certain &quot;detail&quot; and so some scripting here and there was required to make it happen - obviously in Perl.</p>

<p>Greg London gave a talk based on his book, <a href="http://www.Greg%20London.com/bountyhunters/">Bounty Hunters (Metaphors for Fair Intellectual Property Laws)</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The metaphors we use to describe the abstract concept of intellectual works bring along their own set of baggage. The metaphor of &quot;property&quot; automatically invokes the idea of &quot;owner&quot; and &quot;theft&quot; and &quot;pirate&quot;. But some metaphors describe reality better than others. This book introduces the metaphor of authors and inventors as Bounty Hunters. The public offers a bounty to any individual willing to create some as-yet- undiscovered work. Creators provide a &quot;service&quot; in the same vein as a Bounty Hunter provides a service of catching bad guys.</p>

<p><em>Cool Uses for Perl: &quot;Bring a fun script to show.&quot;</em></p>
<p><strong>Bill Ricker</strong> started us off by presenting some scripts he's written for analyzing and creating cryptograms, interspersed with interesting tidbits from the history of cryptography.</p>
<p><strong>Ronald J Kimball</strong> followed with some scripts he's written for solving cryptograms. We also discussed some of the shortcomings to his brute force approach, particularly the problem of proper nouns.</p>
<p><strong>Tim Kohl</strong> then reviewed a short script that finds words whose digital sums add up to 666. (e.g. cat = 3+1+20 = 24) Except it really looks for 111, because it multiplies the digital sum by 6, because that's what the TV evangelist who inspired this script did. We had fun looking through the words that the script found.</p>
<p>After that people threw out a few questions for discussion. One was a tab-delimited file transposition issue that was then discussed on the list. Another was about recursively copying directories in Perl; the File::NCopy module was suggested.</p>
<p>The pizza and soda were generously sponsored by monger <strong>Greg London</strong>.<br />
Greg has two books available through his website, &lt;http://www.Greg London.com/&gt;: <em>Impatient Perl</em> and <em>Hunger Pangs</em>, a science fiction novel. Greg London also has inevitable options.</p>

<p>(<em>Narrator: kWiki served us well for several years, but the frictionless registration meant it collected SEO spam, which eventually got tiring. I even discovered one cluster in this 2d history conversion!</em>)</p>
